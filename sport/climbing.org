:END:
: 1. warm up the shoes by inserting just the tip
: 2. clean them from the chalk
: 3. step on the tip of the toe, so you can maneuver, NOT with the side of the shoe so you have to lift the leg to change angle
: 4. look where you place your feet
: 5. climb silently to practice good footwork
: 6. on structures place feet as far as possible from the wall, so you push into the wall, not away from it
: 7. also drop heel to get more surface if it is sloped down
: 8. flagging
: 9. drop knee, be careful of tendons tho
: 10. toe hook - make room for the foot, train abs
: 11. heel hook - train hip flexibility
: 12. bicycle

good advice on legs/feet placement
