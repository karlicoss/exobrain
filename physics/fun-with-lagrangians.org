One could just say it's pointless to try different shapes because the normal lagrangian works. Analogy is aaronsons speculations on l2 norm for quantum mechanics

:  ‚ÄúHere is how it works: Suppose that for all paths, SS is very large compared to¬†‚Ñè‚Ñè. One path contributes a certain amplitude. For a nearby path, the phase is quite different, because with an enormous¬†SS even a small change in¬†SS means a completely different phase‚Äîbecause ‚Ñè‚Ñè is so tiny. So nearby paths will normally cancel their effects out in taking the sum‚Äîexcept for one region, and that is when a path and a nearby path all give the same phase in the first approximation (more precisely, the same action within¬†‚Ñè‚Ñè). Only those paths will be the important ones. So in the limiting case in which Planck‚Äôs constant¬†‚Ñè‚Ñè goes to zero, the correct quantum-mechanical laws can be summarized by simply saying: ‚ÄòForget about all these probability amplitudes. The particle does go on a special path, namely, that one for which SS does not vary in the first approximation.‚Äô That‚Äôs the relation between the principle of least action and quantum mechanics. The fact that quantum mechanics can be formulated in this way was discovered in 1942 by a student of that same teacher, Bader, I spoke of at the beginning of this lecture. [Quantum mechanics was originally formulated by giving a differential equation for the amplitude (Schr√∂dinger) and also by some other matrix mathematics (Heisenberg).]

in classical mechanics, lagrangian blablabla
but what if we use a different function, which is not included in the textbooks

complete bullshit
well maybe they don't include it in the textbook for reasons

: This is a graph of potential, which also serves as an analogy that sort of helps you figure out what the overall force on an orbiting object is: if you placed a ball on this surface and it was going to roll "downhill", which way would it go? The five crosses mark points where the top surface is flat, so an object at those points will experience no overall force acting on it (if it's orbiting at the same speed as the moon). These are therefore pseudo-stable points where you could leave a satellite orbiting.
