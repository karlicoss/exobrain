(I think, please correct me if I'm wrong here). The fundamental idea is that the action integral defines the quantum mechanical amplitude for the position of the particle, and the amplitude is stable to interference effects (-->has nonzero probability of occurrence) only at extrema or saddle points of the action integral. The particle really does explore all alternative paths probabilistically.

For most potentials, however, only sufficiently short true trajectories have minimum action; the others have an action saddle point. "Sufficiently short" means that the final space-time event occurs before the so-called kinetic focus event of the trajectory.

infer ansatz for action from dimensional analysis

S_nonrel = int 1/2 m v^2(t) dt
hamilton's equation: dv/dt = 0, hence constant velocity

doesn't work for sr, rationale: is not forbidding v > c.

require action to be Lorentz scalar

S = -mc int ds -- in the nonrelativistic limit results in same physics ans nonrel lagrangian
also, that explains the fact that particle traces the path minimizing spacetime interval


momentum and hamiltonian -- coincide with energy
reparameterisation: express invariant via square root of metric and coord. derivatives


right, and we get euler-lagrange equations as a result d^2 x^u/ds^2 = 0 -- basically 4-velocity is constant!

: Although the action S may not generally have a meaningful interpretation, there is an alternative formulation of the EL-equations which gives an equation that gives the value of S directly but not the function that achieves the minimum value of S. This equation is called the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and is also a very widely studied equation, particularly in the context of conservation laws and symplectic geometry. The standard method of solving the HJ-equation is by the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations are precisely the Hamiltonian equations also learned in a typical mechanics course.

: The minimum value of S is guaranteed to exist under certain conditions on L. (Most of the standard theorems require some sort of convexity condition on L.)
: Under the same conditions, the minimum value of S (and which functions achieve that minimum) can be found by solving the associated Euler-Lagrange equations, which is a set of coupled, non-linear partial differential equations. (The EL-equations are found by using L.)

: This study started in the 1930s (?), and Douglas discovered necessary and sufficient conditions for a Lagrangian to exist. These conditions, which you would think should be called the Douglas conditions, are called the Helmholtz conditions. (Douglas was a mathematician who won a Fields Medal for his work in the calculus of variations, specifically in the theory of minimal surfaces (think: soap films).) These conditions though are not at all easy to verify though. The conditions are of the form "Lagrangian exists if there is a non-singular matrix G such that (1), (2), and (3)". The first condition is purely algebraic, the second condition is that a certain ODE for the components of G have a solution, and the third condition is that a certain system of coupled PDE's for the components of G have a solution. The third condition is the one that is not at all easy to verify.

: Furthermore, whereas in Lagrangian mechanics there is a dependence between the generalized coordinates q and their velocities (the latter being the time derivatives of the former), in Hamiltonian mechanics the momenta are to be regarded are independent from the generalized coordinates.
: With these new coordinates, one proceeds to demand again that the action is minimized, and, instead of the Euler-Lagrange equations, one finds what are known as Hamilton's canonical equations. Again these are the equations of motion of the system, which are to be solved in order to find the trajectory. One key difference is that if your system required N generalized coordinates, and thus N Euler-Lagrange equations, there will be 2N Hamilton canonical equations but they are "half as difficult" to solve.
: That's the best I can do without getting technical. Also, Hamiltonian mechanics is cooler, just saying.
