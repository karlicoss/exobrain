so the idea is that some systems behave as a function of their components (and each component is a function of its subcomponents etc)
(sort of like dynamic programming?)

the coupling can express interaction between particles, e.g. for a magnetic system it can express tendency of neighbouring particles to oppose their spins
if we have parameters, describing the system, we can iterate the process (going from smaller to larger subproblems)?
sometimes we'll run into 'fixed points' (of coupling/macro parameters?), which correspond to phase transitions

: Molecular hydrogen occurs in two isomeric forms, one with its two proton nuclear spins aligned parallel (orthohydrogen), the other with its two proton spins aligned antiparallel (parahydrogen).[1] These two forms are often referred to as spin isomers.[2]
: 
: Parahydrogen is in a lower energy state than is orthohydrogen. At room temperature and thermal equilibrium, thermal excitation causes hydrogen to consist of approximately 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. When hydrogen is liquified at low temperature, there is a slow spontaneous transition to a predominantly para ratio, with the released energy having implications for storage. Essentially pure parahydrogen form can be obtained at very low temperatures, but it is not possible to obtain a sample containing more than 75% orthohydrogen by heating.

The symmetric state has the lower energy because of lower kinetic energy, not potential energy.
: Due to electron cloud merging, for the symmetric state the electron to electron repulsion energy is 3 eV lower than you would get if the electrons were point charges located at the nuclei. For the antisymmetric state, it is 5.8 eV lower.
: As a consequence, the antisymmetric state also has less potential energy with respect to these repulsions. Adding it all together, the symmetric state has quite a lot less kinetic energy than the antisymmetric one.

: In contrast, the hypothetical He2 molecule requires four electrons to fill its molecular orbitals, as in Figure 9.33(b). Because only two electrons can be put in the 1s orbital, the other two must be placed in the *1s. The energy decrease from the two electrons in the bonding molecular orbital is offset by the energy increase from the two electrons in the antibonding orbital. (In fact, antibonding molecular orbitals are slightly more unfavorable than bonding orbitals are favorable. Thus, whenever there is an equal number of electrons in bonding and antibonding orbitals, the energy is slightly higher than it is for the isolated atoms and no bond is formed.) Hence, He2 is not a stable molecule. Molecular orbital theory correctly predicts that hydrogen forms diatomic molecules but helium does not.

: For instance, “electron a” might be near the first proton and “electron b” might be in another state around the same proton. We’ll disregard such a case, since it will certainly have higher energy (because of the large Coulomb repulsion between the two electrons). For greater accuracy, we would have to include such states, but we can get the essentials of the molecular binding by considering just the two states of Fig. 10–4. To this approximation we can describe any state by giving the amplitude ⟨1|ϕ⟩ to be in the state |1⟩ and an amplitude ⟨2|ϕ⟩ to be in state |2⟩. In other words, the state vector |ϕ⟩ can be written as the linear combination
: |ϕ⟩=∑i|i⟩⟨i|ϕ⟩.

: which is −|I⟩, as required. So if we bring two hydrogen atoms near to each other with their electrons spinning in the same direction, they can go into the state |I⟩ and not state |II⟩. But notice that state |I⟩ is the upper energy state. Its curve of energy versus separation has no minimum. The two hydrogens will always repel and will not form a molecule. So we conclude that the hydrogen molecule cannot exist with parallel electron spins. And that is right.

: The proton/neutron attraction is very strong via this force, which is why nuclei must be made of a mixture of them.

: As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be "shaken" back and forth at the same frequency.[13] The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them
: Describing it as "absorbed and re-emitted" makes me think way too much that some electron absorbs the energy, enters a discrete excited state for some time, and then transitions back to a lower-energy state while giving off a photon.

  : But why don't electrons get stuck to the glue and end up in the nucleus too, like some sort of Plum Pudding Model? The answer is very simple: electrons don't have a nuclear charge so they are invisible to the strong nuclear force. This is a very cool part of the Standard Model of Particle Physics- there are three families of particles, the quarks, the leptons, and the gauge bosons. The quarks have this nuclear charge so they are forced to be bound into big fat nuclear particles like protons and neutrons and mesons and baryons, while the leptons, or electron family, have no nuclear charge, and so they are lighter and much more spry.

So, C02 is dissolved in the fizzy drink. When you shake it, you introduce air bubbles, which act as nucleation sites for the gas. When you open the bottle, they start expanding, avalanching even more nucleation sites.
You can 'disarm' the bottle by carefully removing the bubbles (e.g. tapping on the sides of the bottles)
Menthos got a rough surface, so it acts as a good nucleation site too.

I agree with Einstein when he says "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough", and since Eric talks in such a convoluted manner about his theory (even in his lecture), it seems to me that Eric's goal is NOT to present his idea.. but to plant this idea in his audience that he is right and the entire academic community is corrupt and wrong.

TLDR: individual solutions are just simple linear oscillations, but if you add two solutions up with different phases/frequencies you can get the resulting vectors to rotate. polariser projects it into some linear subspace
there is also a wave plate, which passes through it light in different directions with different phase shifts. So you can convert linear light into circularly polarised

: For a given temperature, pressure, and volume, the only other quantity of interest is the number of particles.
: Their masses do not matter because this is already taken into account in the temperature (average kinetic energy), so all systems of "ideal gasses" (or billiard balls) with the same P, V, T and particle number behave in the same way.

:  ~~Electronics~~ Electrons (thanks /u/StopDataAbuse) push each other away because of their negativity. This is what transfers the signal, and goes at about 50% to 99% of the speed of light depending on the material. Note that this is not related to the actual speed of the electrons themselves.
:  Now the speed of the electrons themselves is more interesting (I think). I once calculated this and I'll do it again for fun. Let's take a simple DC circuit:
:  3 volt power source, 3 ohm resistor giving 1A of current. Lets take 18 awg copper wires with a cross section surface of 0.823mm^2 according to [this](http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_awg_to_metric). The length of the wires we'll define as L meter, as you'll see it doesn't matter which L we pick as long as we ignore the resistance it brings.
:  The volume of the wire is 0.823mm^2 * L meter = 0.823 10^-6 * L m^3. The density of the wire is (from Wikipedia) 8.96 g * cm^-3  = 8960 kg * m^-3. Multiply those numbers and we'll get the weight of the wire, which is 7.374 * L * 10^-3 kg. I searched for the number of free electrons every copper atom has, and a google search returns 1. So now we need the number of atoms in those wires. 7.347 * L g / (63.546 g / mol) * 6.022 * 10^23 / mol = 6.988 * 10^22 L. That's the number of free electrons in the wires. 1A is 1C / s = 6.241 * 10^18 electrons per second. That's the number of electrons that flow into the wire and out the other end every second. Divide 6.988 * 10^22 L with 6.241 * 10^18 / s and you'll get 11197 * L s. That's the number of seconds any electron stays in the wires before leaving the other end. Divide the length by this time and you'll get the speed: speed = L meters (as the length of the wires were L) / (11197Ls) = 8.93 × 10^-5 m / s. That's not very fast. It would take over 3 hours to travel through a 1 meter wire. Hope I got all the numbers right :S

hmm so inside black holes particles can technically have negative energy because of the curvature?
large black holes don't radiate much because curvature on the horizon is low
