: The other thing you should know is that Copenhagen is not any longer widely accepted amongst people who actually work on interpretations of QM or in foundational physics in general, it's just accepted outside the community as something that most people have at least some knowledge of.
: Now, what's the problem with Copenhagen. The biggest one is the so-called measurement problem, that there is an ill-defined delineation between a system and its observer, or between "quantum" and "classical". There's may others though, e.g. that randomness is postulated rather than a result of the theory.


Pilot wave theory: the pilot wave, particle follows it. Bohm trajectory.
If we could determine position and velocity, we would be able to predict trajectory exactly.

Incompatible with relativity, non-local.

Левый игрок: получает $a$, вводит $c$. Второй игрок: получает $b$, вводит $d$. Победа -- если $c \otimes d = a \lor b$.

Оптимальная стратегия: один игрок вводит $0$, другой -- $1$. В $\frac34$ случаев $a \lor b$ равен $1$, соответственно, они будут выигрывать с вероятностью в $p_C = \frac34$ процентов.

Как доказать, что нельзя больше:

- Перебрать все стратегии (рассмотреть 16 случаев, ни одна не дает больше $\frac34$, значит, и смешанная не даст больше)
- Заметим, что $c$($d$) можно выразить как линейную функцию от $a$($b$): $c = \lambda a \otimes \mu$, $d = \lambda' b \otimes \mu'$, их xor тоже линеен, а функция «или» в правой части нелинейна, поэтому будет фейл хотя бы в одном из четырех случаев.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/437/what-equation-describes-the-wavefunction-of-a-single-photon
: In quantum field theory, the Dirac equation and the Schrödinger equation have very different roles. The Dirac equation is an equation for the field, which is not a particle. The time evolution of a particle, ie, a quantum state, is always given by the Schrödinger equation. The hamiltonian for this time evolution is written in terms of fields which obey a certain equation themselves. So, the proper answer is: Schrödinger equation with a hamiltonian given in terms of a massless vector field whose equation is nothing else but Maxwell's equation.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/251673/can-particle-quantum-spin-be-described-with-a-wave-function
: Within the context of first quantization (the Schrodinger equation), spin itself is not characterized by the spatial or momentum space wave function (the function that defines a complex quantity over all space). It is instead treated with a separate Hilbert space that quantifies the spin states 'tacked on' to this wavefunction by an outer product. It is a matter of semantics whether you consider 'wavefunction' to refer to the complex field alone, or the composite field/spin hilbert spaces.
: More advanced field equations incorporate spin more naturally. The Dirac equation, for example, no longer describes the evolution of a complex scalar field, but the evolution of a four-vector, that naturally describes spin states. For this system, spin isis characterized in the wavefunction itself.

:  Excellent questions - the answers are very subtle.
: 
:  First of all, let's look at your first question, why exchange has to be symmetric or antisymmetric. You may be surprised to know that It's actually a peculiarity of having 3 (actually, just of having more than 2) spatial dimensions.
: 
:  To see why this is, let's think first about how to implement particle exchange. A careful way to do this is to imagine that you start with two particles and slowly drag one of them around the other one until it's on the other side, then slide both particles over so that they are in the initial positions. You should try to draw this if my description is confusing. The statistics shouldn't depend on *how* you drag one particle around the other, just that you complete one half loop.
: 
:  Now, suppose you exchange the particles twice. That's the same as dragging one particle halfway around the other, and then doing it again, that is, having one particle make a full loop around the other one. Now here's the key point: again, the result here shouldn't depend on the exact shape or size of the loop, only that the particles have been exchanged twice. In two dimensions, this loop must contain the other particle, and you cannot shrink the loop to zero size without crashing the first particle into the second at some point. However, in three dimensions, you can push the loop out of the original plane - in fact, you can shrink the loop to zero size while always keeping the first particle far away from the second particle. (Sorry I don't have pictures! Try drawing some.) This means that two exchanges *must* have the same effect as doing nothing at all, since the statistics shouldn't depend on what the loop looks like! That is, a single exchange can *only* either give you a minus sign or no change at all, so that you get no change upon doing it twice. In 2D, this is not true - in fact, you can get [anyons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon) in 2D.
: 
:  This exhausts my expertise for lay explanations to your questions - unfortunately I don't have a non-technical answer to the others. Hopefully someone else can fill in. But I'll give a couple of starting points.
: 
:  Your second question, of why a particle can't have other spins. ~~It's a result of putting special relativity and quantum mechanics together, actually, in 3 spatial dimensions. For the mathematically inclined, it has to do with the fact that 1/2-integer and integer spins are the only allowed representations of the Lorentz group (which is the set of symmetries of spacetime in special relativity).~~ (EDIT: Important correction given as a response.)
: 
:  And finally, the connection between the two - the [spin-statistics theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93statistics_theorem) tells you that bosons have integer spin and fermions have half-integer spin. This again relies on special relativity and having 3 spatial dimensions.

: That is a weak interaction effect and not something mediated by the electromagnetic interaction, which was specifically what the OP was asking about.
: To discuss that we'd really need to move to QFT and beyond just the Schrodinger equation.
: Though I presume the next logical question is why the weak interaction doesn't induce electron capture with hydrogen...
: In this case, it is because a free neutron is a higher energy, less stable system. Electron capture is only relevant in systems where the resulting neutron is stabilized by the rest of the nucleus.
: In cases where the neutron is *not* stabilized, you get positron emission. It is no accident that positron emission is a *common* decay mode among neutron rich nuclei.
