We promised to state Einstein's equation in plain English, but have not done so yet. Here it is
   Given a small ball of freely falling test particles initially at rest with respect to each other, the rate at which it begins to shrink is proportional to its volume times: the energy density at the center of the ball, plus the pressure in the $x$ direction at that point, plus the pressure in the $y$ direction, plus the pressure in the $z$ direction.

** DONE suppose metric is dS = x^2 dx + dy^2.  What does that mean?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       sppsmtrcsdsxdxdywhtdsthtmn
:END:
first, analyse the dS. The further away we are from origin, the longer is line element.
TODO what does that mean? 
TODO dS = d(x^2/2) + dy^2 -- wonder if that transformation is useful?

- So, our metric tensor is Diag[x^2, 1]?
  TODO is the metric being positive definite important? -- ok, if it's not, that's non Riemannian geometry, apparently some crazy shit.

Geodesic equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_the_geodesic_equations#The_geodesic_equation
TODO t is arbitrary parameter?
d^2 x^a/dt^2 + G^a_bc dx^b/dt dx^c/dt = 0
so we need Christoffel symbols. for diagonal metric, we can cheat https://math.stackexchange.com/a/799027/15108
 since g_xx = x^2 and g_yy = 1, we can see only G^i_ii are non zero and G_xx = 1/x, G_yy = 0.
hence, substituting into the equation above, get system
 d^2 x/dt^2 + 1/x (dx/dt)^2 = 0
 d^2 y/dt^2 = 0 
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%5E2y%2Fdt%5E2+%3D+0,+d%5E2x%2Fdt%5E2+%2B+1%2Fx+(dx%2Fdt)%5E2+%3D+0
so,
y = yt + C -- right, that means geodesic in flat space got constant velocity and direction. makes sense

x = A sqrt(B + 2 t)

Solve the IVP next. Assume x0 = 0, y0 =0; we get
  y = y'_0 t (duh)
  x = x'_0 sqrt(2 t)

Right, so what all of that means? 
In a sense, it's just moving slower through X axis in comparison to as if it was moving in 'normal' metric?
but basically, it's just a coordinate transformation right?
I guess the difference is: we have figured out via experiment that our world has got 'uniform' coordinates.
in the world with the metric above:
wait... we haven't introduced time there. so doesn't make much sense to reason about it.
ok suppose we do introduce time. assuming they dependency of parameter on time is linear (is it??), then suggest the following experiment:
  Alice: goes for 1 minute in one direction, then turns back and walks for one minute.
  Bob: goes for 1 minute in the orthogonal direction, then turns back and walks for one minute.
hmm, how do they measure distance? ah doesn't even matter, what matters is that they don't meet at the same point?
oh.. wait
ah it's fine. one observer travels 1 minute up, 1 minute right, 1 minute down, 1 minute left. nope.. wouldn't work.
so it is undetectable after all??
this is actually quite similar to universe expansion?
ok, so take two observers. one is at 0, another is at 100.
right... so curves don't have intrinsic curvature! therefore, curvature is undetectable by the inhabitants of that world

G^x_yy = -1/2 1/g_xx delta_x g_yy = -1/2 1/y^2 d(x^2) = -x/y^2. Same for G^y_xx = -y/x^2

in general its too hard to do geodesics in full generality. sooften we justchoose a path and see if its a geodesic! and a natural one to choose is a pathdefined by only one of the parameters - its called a parameter curve

ex5.pdf in downloads -- direct solution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution -- might be useful
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric#Alternative_coordinates
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_element
line element is g(dq, dq)
right, so I'm gonna need spherical or cylindrical geometry
The easiest way to find the metric of the 2-sphere (or the sphere in any dimen-sion) is to picture it as embedded in one higher dimension of Euclidean space,then restrict to constant radius -- hmm..


So Christoffel symbols are like the metric - they do tell us about curvature(what we are interested in) but they also tell us about what coordinate systemwe have chosen (which isn’t at all fundamental).

: Geometrically, the Ricci curvature is the mathematical object that controls the growth rate of the volume of metric balls in a manifold.
: 
: Paralllel transport on the Earth surface might change the direction
: 
: For fun, notice that if we think of the earth as a unit sphere, it's area is 4 pi, and our Roman has just travelled around a region of land having area one eighth of that, hence pi/2. His javelin has rotated by an angle of pi/2! This is no coincidence: on the unit sphere, whenever you go around a simple closed curve enclosing an area A, parallel translation gives a rotation of angle A.
: 
: 
: Again, all this is easier to visualize in 2d space rather than 4d spacetime. A person walking on a sphere `following their nose' will trace out a geodesic -- that is, a great circle. Suppose two people stand side-by-side on the equator and start walking north, both following geodesics. Though they start out walking parallel to each other, the distance between them will gradually start to shrink, until finally they bump into each other at the north pole. If they didn't understand the curved geometry of the sphere, they might think a `force' was pulling them together.
: 
: Similarly, in general relativity gravity is not really a `force', but just a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime. Note: not the curvature of space, but of spacetime. The distinction is crucial. If you toss a ball, it follows a parabolic path. This is far from being a geodesic in space: space is curved by the Earth's gravitational field, but it is certainly not so curved as all that! The point is that while the ball moves a short distance in space, it moves an enormous distance in time, since one second equals about 300,000 kilometers in units where $c = 1$. This allows a slight amount of spacetime curvature to have a noticeable effect.

: n the present day universe, this does not happen for two reasons. First, the gas is unstable to fragmentation as it collapses. The reason for this is that the Jeans mass, the smallest mass that is likely to collapse, scales as T3/2/ρ1/2, where T is the temperature and ρ the density. If the gas can cool as it collapses, then the temperature remains roughly constant, the Jeans mass falls and the cloud breaks up into smaller cores. These cores are usually much smaller than the (at least) several solar masses required to form a black hole (see below).

: David Hilbert discovered general relativity at practically the same moment as Einstein.

: I believe there was a race at that time, physicists knew there was a need to generalize SR to non-inertial frames, and that perhaps that it involved metric spaces (following the lorentz transformations). Hilbert was working on it, but apparently did not make much progress at deriving the GR equations (I don't have a source, sorry -- scattered articles on GR). You're right that eventually he or someone else would have made it, but how long would it take is speculation.

: I think the main takeaway is that Hilbert and Einstein ended in amicable terms, and it seems both contributed greatly to eachother's result.
