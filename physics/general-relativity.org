We promised to state Einstein's equation in plain English, but have not done so yet. Here it is
   Given a small ball of freely falling test particles initially at rest with respect to each other, the rate at which it begins to shrink is proportional to its volume times: the energy density at the center of the ball, plus the pressure in the $x$ direction at that point, plus the pressure in the $y$ direction, plus the pressure in the $z$ direction.

huh!

  if we are referring to the same Levi-Civita symbol, i.e. the completely antisymmetric symbol, then this is not a tensor. It is a tensor density of weight −1, which means that under a general coordinate transformation it gets multiplied by the inverse Jacobian of the transformation. 
hmm

mass is a fixed quantity independent of inertial frame, 'rest mass'
hmmm, unclear...
wiki says that by definition the invariant mass is ratio of 4-momentum to 4-velocity
  The invariant mass, rest mass, intrinsic mass, proper mass, or in the case of bound systems simply mass, is the portion of the total mass of an object or system of objects that is independent of the overall motion of the system. 
that actually makes more sense

** DONE suppose metric is dS = x^2 dx + dy^2.  What does that mean?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       adf6775ceaccd5b60b5c2c57ca3897e1
:END:
first, analyse the dS. The further away we are from origin, the longer is line element.
TODO what does that mean? 
TODO dS = d(x^2/2) + dy^2 -- wonder if that transformation is useful?

- So, our metric tensor is Diag[x^2, 1]?
  TODO is the metric being positive definite important? -- ok, if it's not, that's non Riemannian geometry, apparently some crazy shit.

Geodesic equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_the_geodesic_equations#The_geodesic_equation
TODO t is arbitrary parameter?
d^2 x^a/dt^2 + G^a_bc dx^b/dt dx^c/dt = 0
so we need Christoffel symbols. for diagonal metric, we can cheat https://math.stackexchange.com/a/799027/15108
 since g_xx = x^2 and g_yy = 1, we can see only G^i_ii are non zero and G_xx = 1/x, G_yy = 0.
hence, substituting into the equation above, get system
 d^2 x/dt^2 + 1/x (dx/dt)^2 = 0
 d^2 y/dt^2 = 0 
https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%5E2y%2Fdt%5E2+%3D+0,+d%5E2x%2Fdt%5E2+%2B+1%2Fx+(dx%2Fdt)%5E2+%3D+0
so,
y = yt + C -- right, that means geodesic in flat space got constant velocity and direction. makes sense

x = A sqrt(B + 2 t)

Solve the IVP next. Assume x0 = 0, y0 =0; we get
  y = y'_0 t (duh)
  x = x'_0 sqrt(2 t)

Right, so what all of that means? 
In a sense, it's just moving slower through X axis in comparison to as if it was moving in 'normal' metric?
but basically, it's just a coordinate transformation right?
I guess the difference is: we have figured out via experiment that our world has got 'uniform' coordinates.
in the world with the metric above:
wait... we haven't introduced time there. so doesn't make much sense to reason about it.
ok suppose we do introduce time. assuming they dependency of parameter on time is linear (is it??), then suggest the following experiment:
  Alice: goes for 1 minute in one direction, then turns back and walks for one minute.
  Bob: goes for 1 minute in the orthogonal direction, then turns back and walks for one minute.
hmm, how do they measure distance? ah doesn't even matter, what matters is that they don't meet at the same point?
oh.. wait
ah it's fine. one observer travels 1 minute up, 1 minute right, 1 minute down, 1 minute left. nope.. wouldn't work.
so it is undetectable after all??
this is actually quite similar to universe expansion?
ok, so take two observers. one is at 0, another is at 100.
right... so curves don't have intrinsic curvature! therefore, curvature is undetectable by the inhabitants of that world
** ok, let's do something more funny... suppose dS = y^2dx^2 + x^2dy^2

in general its too hard to do geodesics in full generality. sooften we justchoose a path and see if its a geodesic! and a natural one to choose is a pathdefined by only one of the parameters - its called a parameter curve

ex5.pdf in downloads -- direct solution

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution -- might be useful
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric#Alternative_coordinates
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_element
line element is g(dq, dq)
right, so I'm gonna need spherical or cylindrical geometry
The easiest way to find the metric of the 2-sphere (or the sphere in any dimen-sion) is to picture it as embedded in one higher dimension of Euclidean space,then restrict to constant radius -- hmm..


So Christoffel symbols are like the metric - they do tell us about curvature(what we are interested in) but they also tell us about what coordinate systemwe have chosen (which isn’t at all fundamental).
