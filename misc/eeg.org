* WAIT [#B] OpenBCI is best apparently?

:END:
At Drexel we've had a lot of success with openBCI. I can't comment on all of the other choices, but I think for the money, OpenBCI is a great choice. We've had an advanced undergraduate co-op in our lab working with it for about 2 months, and he's gotten a 16ch board put together and connected to a 3d printed headset we bought, gotten openBCI fully running, connected it to OpenVIBE and begun running their modules. Full access to the data, including in Matlab.

One option would be to go with OpenBCI hardware and a (relatively) inexpensive proprietary neurofeedback software option like BioEra 290. I have not used BioEra, but it is compatible with OpenBCI and is much more geared towards neurofeedback than BrainBay or OpenViBE. A somewhat more expensive hardware option is Pocket-Neurobics 325, which works with BioEra or BioExplorer, and is apparently popular among home neurofeedback trainers. As @curiositry mentioned, William Croft 104 is a great resource on this topic.

Also, the Arduino community is quite active and helpful. The 32bit version is more powerful, which means that it can do more processing on the signal before it’s sent over bluetooth. If you plan on doing a lot of with tinkering with the code running on the OpenBCI itself, the 32bit version may be a better choice.

Being "strong" means exerting the same amount of force with a lower number of recruited motor units.

: The Emotiv forces the user to use their software. Raw data costs A LOT extra. Muse + OpenBCI give raw eeg data free. In fact, they give everything except the hardware for free. OpenBCI is completely open source (their name is proprietary....for prosperity). Emotiv sensors are finnicky. They work, they don't work. You can never tell when they will have a good or bad day. Look at the community around their hardware (from my comment above).
: OpenBCI gives you the freedom to select your own electrodes (wet, dry, amplified, etc.) You are free to use whichever development platform you are comfortable in (matlab, BCI2000, Python, OpenVibe, Go....)
: Muse has a good set of dry sensors. They work. I've even used them in a project at the SF Exploratorium, and at a Tech summit in Shenzhen.

: After purchasing a Muse headset as part of a project to improve focus & reduce distractibility, I started meditating with the band to determine how it can impact my mental focus.
: The Muse headband is a brain wave tracking device that comes with a cell-phone app to measure effectiveness of any meditation session. There are 7 sensors on the headband to get an overall picture of what the brain is doing.

- ? 4 channels
- ? 269 GBP
- PRO sdk is free
- PRO guy from QS meetup (Tony) recommended it, however his app seemed to be a bit clunky..

- CON dont bother even with trying it [–][deleted] 39 points 1 year ago* 
  : dont bother even with trying it. while Ive not seen a teardown of this device nearly all of these "mind reading" devices are simply a neurosky thinkgear TGAM module in some packaging and rebranded as some new super tech. these modules are the same ones in those japanese cat ears that read your brain and move the ears, the gaming headsets you are supposed to be able to trigger, and the various "personal mental training devices" like this one.
  : its a single channel EEG that basically works as an on off switch when various brainwaves hit enough activity. three problems
  : one or just a few channels is not enough data for any real amount of "sensing" nor is it enough channels of data to even get a basic picture of overall brain activity.
  : these devices are super slow in response time so they are nearly useless. by the time it senses and you notice its like 2 seconds or so. that makes it only useful for these "meditation" applications since no realtime work or actions can be done with them. (otherwise we would be using decades old EEG tech for lots of cool stuff)
  : the actual different brainwaves are usually not individually used and instead are combined into a generic "activity level" which again is of little use.
  : if you really want to mess with them buy any of these devices or any of the "mindflex toys" which contain these modules and read the values directly with a microcontroller.

: If you’re a beginning meditation practitioner, the Muse is great at helping flag when you’re mind is active or calm. The first year of using The Muse, the feedback was amazing to quiet my mind, as I was still learning the basics of the practice.
: But as my skills improved, the device wasn’t as useful as before. I’ve found that if you’re an intermediate or an advanced meditator (whose beta/alpha wave fluctuation are much more subtle), the device is relatively crude in picking up these signals.
: For example, if I’m now in a session and my mind ever so slightly shifts focus away from my breath, I’ll catch these thoughts but it will go undetected on the Muse. I’m in the process of transitioning to a higher-end device that is more accurate and sensitive to these subtle electrical changes in my brainwaves.

: Abstract : This paper presents a comparison between a consumer grade EEG (electroencephalography) amplifier and a medical grade equipment. Using the same set of EEG electrodes, signals recorded from the OpenBCI board are compared side-by-side with those recorded from the g.tec g.USBamp device. Two BCI (brain-computer interface) applications are studied: a P300 speller and a workload estimator. In both applications EEG features are highly correlated. Moreover, the classification performances obtained with the OpenBCI board come close to the accuracy achieved with the g.tec g.USBamp. Overall, these preliminary results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip -- may be an alternative to traditional EEG amplifiers, widening the realm of applications and increasing the number of potential users.

:  **Idea of P300 speller:**
:  Highlight rows and cols and record EEG reaction to these events. If row/col with target character is highlighted \~after 300ms peak on EEG diagram will occur and it's possible to train classifier to  detect it. To remove noise from EEG data repeat it multiple times and use bandpass filter
