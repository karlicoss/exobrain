* thought experiment: you move away from the clock with the speed of light -- you see the same image on the clock (but you are still aging) :grelativity:

- [2021-06-18] huh, what did I mean here?
  you won't move with the speed of light, but even assuming approx lightspeed, you'll see the clock moving slower
  (you can think of it as consecutive 'rays' from ticks taking longer to reach you? not sure if it's flawed)
  maybe I was trying to come up with intuition for remembering that for a moving object time is slower?
  I guess this also makes sense if you think about 4-velocity -- it's magnitude is constant, so any spatial components increase results in temporal component decrease?

: If you like hard sci-fi, Greg Egan has a written a few books that cover what life would be like if there were 2 dimensions of time (http://www.gregegan.net/DICHRONAUTS/DICHRONAUTS.html) or if the dimension of time was sumed instead of subtracted when measuring distance (http://www.gregegan.net/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html)
: It's amazing to think how the universe is ruled by such minute details.
