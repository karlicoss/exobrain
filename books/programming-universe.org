: One counterintuitive result of a computer’s fundamentally logical operation is that its future behavior is intrinsically unpredictable. The only way to find out what a computer will do once it has embarked upon a computation is to wait and see what happens

: But despite their simplicity, they can be programmed to produce patterns of any desired complexity, and the programs that produce these patterns need not possess any apparent order themselves: they can be random sequences of bits.
: The generation of random bits does play a key role in the establishment of order in the universe, just not as directly as Boltzmann imagined

- different observers assign different value for entropy
- total amount of information is invariant though
- the spread of ignorance is reversible (control-not example)
- spread of ignorance is mutual information
