: Not too surprisingly, this is a subject that brings on the defensiveness. It's greeted with diatribes about "real" programming and how drawing lines to connect components is too limiting and links to articles about the glory of raw text files. At one time I would have agreed, but more and more it's starting to smack of nostalgic "that's how it's always been done"-ness. In Microsoft's old QBasic, programs

: Once you've learned a small subset of a language like Python--variables, functions, control flow, arrays, and dictionaries--then features are no longer the issue. Sure, you won't know all the software engineery stuff like exceptions and micromanagement of variable and function scopes, but it's more important to learn how to turn thoughts into code before there's any mention of engineering.

: What struck me about this argument, besides that people actually argue about such things, is how many other respected activities don't have anywhere near the same level of paranoia about protection from mistakes. On the guitar--or any musical instrument--you can play any note at any time, even if it's out of key or, more fundamentally, not played correctly (wrong finger placement or pressure or accidentally muting the string). And people play instruments live, in-concert in front of thousands of people this way, knowing that the solo is improvised in Dorian E, and there's no physical barrier preventing a finger from hitting notes that aren't in that mode. The same goes for sculpting, or painting, or carpentry...almost anything that requires skill.

: One of my favorite non-alphanumeric characters for function names is "?". Why say is_uppercase (or IsUppercase or isUppercase) when you can use the more straightforward Uppercase? instead? That's standard practice in Scheme and Forth, and I'm surprised it hasn't caught on in all new languages.
** [2021-01-05] yep, also in Agda or lisps. Same for dashes, underscores look a bit awkward (e.g. ~uppercase-p~)

: in (open-file), to indicate that a word is low-level and for internal use only. And then there are clever uses of characters in Forth that make related words look related, like this: open{ write-byte write-string etc. }close The brace is part of both open{ and }close. There no reason the braces couldn't be dropped completely, but they provide a visual cue about scope.

: Borland's other languages with "Turbo" in the name--like Turbo C--weren't even remotely close to the compilation speeds of Turbo Pascal. Even Turbo Assembler was slower, thanks in part to the usual step of having to run a linker. So what made Turbo Pascal so fast? Real modules. A

: large percentage of time in C compilers is spent reading and parsing header files. Even a short school assignment may pull in tens of thousands of lines of headers. That's why most C compilers support precompiled headers, though they're often touchy and take effort to set-up.

: Yes, there was a drawback to instantaneous compile times. Fewer optimizations were done, and almost always the resultant code was slower than the C equivalent. But it didn't matter. Removing the gap between the steps of writing and running code was worth more than some amount of additional runtime performance.

: Erlang takes this further by having a separate block of memory for each process, so when the block gets full only that particular block needs to be garbage collected. If it's a 64K block, it takes microseconds to collect, as compared to potentially traversing a heap containing the hundreds of megabytes of data in the full running system. Disallowing destructive updates allows some nice optimizations in the garbage collector, because pointers are guaranteed to reference older objects (this is sometimes called a "unidirectional heap"). Together these are much simpler than building a real-time garbage collector that can survive under the pressure of giant heaps.

: There's another option, too: you could give up. You can stop making things and become a commentator, letting everyone know how messed-up software development is. You can become a philosopher and talk about abstract, big picture views of perfection without ever shipping a product based on those ideals. You can become an advocate for the good and a harsh critic of the bad. But though you might think you're providing a beacon of sanity and hope, you're slowly losing touch with concrete thought processes and skills you need to be a developer. Meanwhile, other people in their pre-epiphany states are using those exact same technologies that you know are broken, and despite everything you do to convince them that this can't possibly work...they're successful.
