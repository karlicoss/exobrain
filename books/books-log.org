Lately, I've been mostly tracking what I've read on [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22191391-dima-gerasimov][goodreads]], sometimes I leave reviews there too.

Here I keep some older notes & some clippings from Kindle... I'm still in the process of trying to publish clippings & highlights.

You might also be interested in my [[file:../toread.org][reading list]].
