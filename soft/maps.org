: Is there an apps/tool for maps that allows you to hide specific places/types from the maps forever? So I get to display more potentially interesting places for me.
: E.g. I almost never need car parks/schools/churches etc on maps, but they are displayed and take up precious space.
: similarly, I want something like a news feed for changes on maps in my local area so I could find out about new places
: The whole thing just makes me so angry, google maps sits on the user-provided data while exposing very primitive and shitty apis. Obviously only fuzzy queries too (so they can maximize their potential for ranking/ads).
: This shit is what makes me a proponent of regulations in tech
: But also it's all pretty depressing, I don't see any efforts by other people to build similar tools, and I'm just discouraged to do anything, I don't have fucking time 😭
: We ended up with a bunch of shitty siloed fuzzy algorithmic tools and everyone is mostly fine with it
: Like, how are we going to build a metaverse if we don't even have a representation of our current physical reality (or even your own flat) in a database??
