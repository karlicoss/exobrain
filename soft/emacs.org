: Why does it exist
: Emacs provides a comprehensive set of customizable variables and hooks as well as a powerful advice system. Sometimes, however, these are not enough and you must override an entire function in order to change a detail of its implementation.
: Such a situation is not ideal, since the original definition of the function might change when you update Emacs or one of its packages, and your overridden version would then be outdated. This could prevent you from benefitting from bugfixes made to the original function, or introduce new bugs into your configuration. Even worse, there is no way to tell when the original definition has changed! The correctness of your configuration is basically based on faith.

: My Personal Emacs History

** [2019-10-21] As a drawback, I sometimes seem to repel others when I start praising my setup. My long journey with Emacs did result in a personal cozy environment that normal computer users do not seem to understand any more. Therefore, I have to remember to suppress the urge of mentioning the virtues of my environment. I have to stick to mentioning only the ultimate basics when I promote Emacs to normal computer users. Which is a pity, in my opinion.

: It's the end of 2019, I realized that I have worked on [M-EMACS](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d) for nearly a year now. M-EMACS is my personal Emacs setup and configurations, I have been spreading it for some time in comment sections and received some positive feedback from the community, but somehow I never bother to write a post to officially introduce it ;)


: So here I am.


: Besides some Emacs' killer-features nicely configured out-of-box for you (e.g `lsp`, `ivy`, `company`, `erc`, `eaf`, `mu4e`, `tramp`, etc.), M-EMACS README is aiming to be one of the best `org-mode` Emacs config available. While heavily using `use-package` in the code, and providing a link with a one-sentence description to each package it uses, it also has a little `Prerequisite` note for any *heavier* packages that require more setup than just copy-and-paste elisp code ;)


: With [M-EMACS](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d), I am also exploring a new way to organize Emacs config files. AFAIK, most of the people (who cared enough to heavily organize `.emacs.d`) in the community either put their config in a subdirectory called `lisp` or `elisp` with many files like `init-xx.el`, or they put their entire config in a **HUGE** `.org` file with numerous `#+BEGIN_SRC` and `#+END_SRC` blocks, and use `org-babel-load-file` in `init.el` to load all the elisp code on startup. The former is well-organized but can get complicated and frustrating for anyone other than the owner to navigate through the code. The latter is much more user-friendly, it's so much nicer to navigate through a Github README page and really helpful to any Emacs user who just wants to quickly find a config snippet for a particular package. However, the downside is that `org-babel-load-file` can get *pretty* slow sometimes, wasting a lot of startup time.


: [M-EMACS](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d), on the other hand, combines these two approaches together: all elisp code is organized in an `elisp` folder, with some `#+INCLUDE` statements in an `org` file, elisp code are populated into a Github-friendly README with a single command. Below is the snippet from the [About README](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d#about-readme) section:


: > This README is originated from `init.org` that is generated using `M-x org-gfm-export-to-markdown`. Every block of code is generated through this function - it exports the section of code from the `elisp/` directory. You will not see their presence in `init.org`.


: The result is an organized, detailed and user-friendly README with super-fast startup time, best of both worlds.


: Anyways, enough babbling, feel free to [check it out](https://github.com/MatthewZMD/.emacs.d) during this holiday season :)
