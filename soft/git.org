: Different from SVN
: It is important to note that this is very different from most SCM systems that you may be familiar with. Subversion, CVS, Perforce, Mercurial and the like all use Delta Storage systems - they store the differences between one commit and the next.
: Git does not do this - it stores a snapshot of what all the files in your project look like in this tree structure each time you commit. This is a very important concept to understand when using Git.
: Git’s pack files are carefully constructed to effectively use disk caches and provide “nice” access patterns for common commands and for reading recently referenced objects.

: You may have used git grep to search for some text in your Git project, just as you may have used git diff to view active changes. What do the two have in common? They both display some contents in your repository, and both have support to show the surrounding function context with -p (short for --show-function) or -W (short for --function-context), respectively.

: It’s a better rebase. So much better that it should be obligatory. You can split commits, batch rename them, and you don’t have to stash your work first.
