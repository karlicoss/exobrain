example with stripping private todos

why it may seem unreliable or hacky, it's very effortless to try it out and in conjunction with
version control for your outputs, you're unlikely to mess anything up massively

* TODO [#C] Editing blog                                          :cloudmacs:

* if possible, use [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Search-options.html#Search-options][=file:=]] links in =.org= files instead of HTML links :org:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2019-12-21]
:ID:       fpssblssrgmdrgmnlsrchptnsfllnksnrgflsnstdfhtmllnks
:END:
E.g. instead of
: [[./sad-infra.html#why][here]]

, you can use:
: [[file:sad-infra.org::#why][here]]

Benefit of the latter is that link also works in org-mode source (unlike the former). During the export it's automatically resolved to HTML.
* TODO about storing data in git repository, report via diff
