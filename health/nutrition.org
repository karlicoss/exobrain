: Once glucose is inside the liver, glucose is phosphorylated into glucose-6-phosphate, or G6P.
: G6P is further metabolized into triglycerides, fatty acids, glycogen or energy.
: Glycogen is the form in which the body stores glucose. The liver can only store about 100 g of glucose in the form of glycogen.
: The muscles also store glycogen. Muscles can store approximately 500 g of glycogen.
: Because of the limited storage areas, any carbohydrates that are consumed beyond the storage capacity are converted to and stored as fat. There is practically no limit on how many calories the body can store as fat.


: Once your glycogen stores are full, your body stores excess calories from carbohydrate as fat.
: Excess calories from fat and protein intake get stored as fat in the body as well.
: Adipose cells, or fat cells, store the extra calories in the form of triglycerides, a type of fatty acid.
: Most of these fat cells are found between your skin and muscle while others surround your organs
: Everyone has a different number of fat cells, but it's the size of the cells that matters more

**** There are at least two known exceptions to the rule that unsaturated fats are good and saturated fats are bad. The first exception is trans fat, which is a kind of unsaturated fat that increases levels of LDL and the risk of heart disease. Trans fat is found in small quantities in animal fat, and in much larger quantities in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, as may be found in processed foods. The prevailing recommendation is to consume little or no trans fat.

**** The second exception to the "unsaturated good, saturated bad" rule is found in medium chain triglycerides (MCTs). MCTs are found in large amounts in coconut oil. MCTs are generally believed to be especially healthful fats, and in particular have been found in some studies to promote fat burning and decrease appetite.

That being said, polyunsaturated and monounsaturated have been shown to improve heart health. So saturated fats are worse relative to the unsaturated fats, but they are not bad at all. [examine]

:END:
: Whenever you stop eating, your substrate preference will be about 2/3 fat and 1/3 carbohydrates. Those carbohydrates will come from stored glycogen in your liver and muscles.
: When those glycogen stores run out, the liver will try to defend the blood glucose through gluconeogenesis, synthesizing glucose from amino acids from protein broken down elsewhere in the body and glycerol from triglycerides. This metabolic phase is characterized often by decreases in blood sugar and associated tiredness and hunger. It is also the phase in which muscle catabolism progresses at the fastest pace.
: However, 12-24 hours after running out of glycogen, the body will gradually go into ketosis, in which the liver synthesizes ketone bodies from fatty acids. These ketone bodies can substitute and/or replace glucose in the metabolism, reducing the need for breakdown of protein for amino acids for gluconeogenesis. After a couple of days the substrate preference will have changed to 90% fat and 10% carbohydrates, thereby reducing muscle catabolism strongly. This state can be maintained for as long as there is enough fat. The longest documented therapeutic fast was 385 days during 100+ kg weight loss in an obese patient. Mind you that a kg of bodyfat contains enough energy to go for 3-6 days depending on body size and activity level.
: Ketosis and relying predominantly on fats will continue until only the essential bodyfat stores are left at approximately 5-7% in men and 10-14% in women. At this level the substrate preference for fats disappear and muscle catabolism increase sharply again. At this point death will usually occur within very few weeks.

*** gluconeogenesis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       glcngnss
:END:
: Gluconeogenesis highly prioritizes fat metabolism for energy when carbohydrate based sources of glucose are low/empty.
: The entire purpose of fat is to be an energy source when other sources are low, whereas the purpose of muscles are either locomotion or stability.

: Шпинат достаточно богат железом и кальцием, однако усваиванию этих микроэлементов организмом в теории мешают фитиновая кислота и особенно оксалаты, которых в листьях шпината больше, чем в каких бы то ни было иных овощах. Согласно теоретическим моделям взаимодействия химических веществ, при нормальных условиях (отсутствие выраженной гипокальцемии) организм в состоянии усвоить не более 5 % кальция, содержащегося в шпинате[20]. Из всех овощей и фруктов шпинат представляет собой источник кальция с наименьшей биодоступностью[21].
: Вместе с тем, практические эксперименты не всегда подтверждают эти теоретические выкладки. Например, в одном из экспериментов была установлена более высокая усваиваемость железа из шпината по сравнению с железом из не содержащих оксалатов пшеничных отрубей[22].

: Морковь является богатым источником витамина А, который относится к группе жирорастворимых витаминов – для его усвоения в кишечнике он должен сначала соединиться с желчью. Выделение желчи, в свою очередь, зависит от жирности продукта: чем жирнее продукт – тем ее выделяется больше. Сама по себе морковь – продукт нежирный, а значит, и желчи выделяется мало, и витамин А усваивается плохо. Добавление сметаны значительно повышает уровень жирности, желчь начинает выделяться в больших количествах, что в разы увеличивает усвояемость витамина А.

: These are averages of course so slightly undercooking the greens will save more of the vitamin C and folate while overcooking will result in more losses than in the USDA paper.

: The different balance is not enough to get them into ketosis.
: Too much protein knocks you out of ketosis. Also traditional societies tend to eat their meat quite fresh, which means it still has glycogen content.
: A ketogenic diet needs to contain mostly fat to keep you in ketosis. Such an abundance of fat is a relatively new phenomenon I believe. You basically need 4 calories fat to 1 calorie of protein.

:   carb cycle. So every 5th day I'll eat 350g to 400g of carbs in one day and on every other day I keep my carbs down to around 50g or 75g.
: 
: The day right before I carb load my muscles look noticeably flatter which I attribute to glycogen depletion, and getting a pump seems almost impossible. I especially notice it in my arms (both the flatness and inability to get a pump). However, the day after my carb loading day, every thing looks much fuller and I can get a ridiculous pump just from a warm-up set.
: 
: Those are the main things I notice.

- Humans are the only animals who consume milk after having started eating solid food
- Lactose is milk sugar. Can't be absorbed, must be digested by lactase. Lactase production decays after childhood (since body thinks it's no longer needed). Northern races are more lactose tolerant than sourthern.
- You can buy lactose-digesting enzymes in liquid form now

: You'd probably do well to include a mix of prebiotic fibers to support a diverse range of microbes, as Ample does - here are some commonly available options:
: tapioca starch, raw potato starch, green banana powder (resistant starch)
: oat bran fiber (beta glucans)
: psyllium husk (mucilage)
: acacia gum (gum)
: pectin (pectin)
: inulin (fructan)
: You may find that you have a negative reaction (lots of gas and bloating) to one or more of these options. I stopped using inulin and tapioca starch in my products at Super Body Fuel because so many people had really bad gas from them. But if you can tolerate them, they're great.
: 
: Taking probiotics can also help if you're having bad reactions to certain fiber sources, though it's pretty hit-or-miss. You may have to try a number of different brands to see what works for you.

** TODO protein and ketosis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       prtnndktss
:END:
:  Although there are no hard and fast rules for how much protein can inhibit ketosis, some individuals have reported trouble maintaining ketosis if they consume too much protein per day, or even excessive amounts of protein at a given meal.
:  To the contrary, some individuals have eaten 1.2 grams protein/lb or higher and had no problems establishing and maintaining ketosis.
: 
:  l;dr: excess protein is not carbs and probably isn't all that bad. Part of it gets turned to ketones, part of it gets used directly for energy, and part gets turned to glucose. The story is very complicated, and that being said, some people swear by limiting protein to maximize fat loss, and maybe it works, but the story isn't so black & white.

: When talking to multiple dietitians and always hearing something different (some recommending under what I found in studies, some recommending over), I wanted to gather all the studies I found from all my research so I could figure out what actually is the right amount for *most* people.
: The document below (download either as a google spreadsheet or Excel) shows an average protein intake of **1.46-1.8 g/kg/day** across the 9 studies that I included. There are an additional 26 studies/links that I did not include in the average for various reasons. But I would like for anyone to look over everything included and recommend/correct any issues they see.
: Note: This is specifically focusing on people who want to maintain/build muscle during a period of resistant training or have an athletic lifestyle.
