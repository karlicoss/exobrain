: Your blood vessels are going to expand when the ambient temperature increases, causing decreased blood pressure throughout your body.. This means less blood flow, especially to the brain. The benefit to this of course is your body can cool down.


: Ever notice why class rooms are notorious for being cold? (at least mine were) It's because an ambient temperature of about 68 degrees is just enough that the body constricts the blood vessels of the body, increasing blood pressure to help maintain routine body temperature. The side effect of this is (you guessed it) increased blood flow through the brain, causing you to feel more focused and alert.
: 
: The greater effect of this can be seen in studying the climates of different cultures. One theory that's pretty popular (and I think might have some hint of selective bias, so work with me here), is that the reason many cultures from tropical regions never ascended to a high level of technological and social developments is because of the hot weather causing the people to be more inclined to settle. While those who lived in cold regions with harsh winters, were home to people who were more intelligent.
: 
: It makes sense when you consider the difficulty in trying to live through a harsh winter. You have to be patient, strong, and above all else, smart. A tropical climate is much more forgiving on the body in the long term, because it mimics the conditions of our own body. Pretty cool stuff in my opinion.

It generates a sleep score which I find pretty useless cause it mostly correlates with sleep length (e.g. you could have a 9 hour sleep and wake up feeling terrible whereas the sleep score would be 100, or you could sleep for 5 hours and be fresh and energised and the score would be 50). I think the most useful feature is it tries to infer when you had deep/light/REM sleep, after couple of weeks I noticed I got a REM phase almost every days at 5 a.m., tried setting an alarm for 5 and after a while I managed to get used to be waking up

:  A pillow that provides the correct support is a key factor in getting the best night's sleep possible. At JYSK you'll find pillows in two different heights: low and high. When selecting the pillow's height, keep in mind that your ideal sleeping position is one in which your spinal column is completely straight. Your preferred sleeping position should determine which height you should select.

:  Do you prefer to sleep on your back? Then your pillow should be low with primary support under the neck. To suit this purpose an ergonomic special pillow in foam or natural latex is suitable. It provides additional support under the neck for optimal support.

:END:
https://www.reddit.com/r/IsItBullshit/comments/8rjo02/isitbullshit_sleeping_with_a_hard_mattress_is/e0rtxhb/ 
:  It entirely depends on your predominant sleeping position. A hard mattress is awful for side sleepers:
: 1) your spine is misaligned (assuming your shoulder width > hip width). For a quick visual, get somebody to take a photo with you on your side, topless, on a hard floor. Since your shoulders are the widest part of your body, your spine has nowhere to go except to slope upwards.
: 2) pressure points on hips ands shoulders.
: 3) Because of point (1) above, your head is further away from the mattress than it should be, and to compensate for this error you need a really thick pillow. The trouble is, most people do not use a pillow that's thick enough, so you lose neck alignment in the opposite direction to the misalignment in point (1) above. Double trouble. Optimal = a softer mattress + skinny pillow.
: Your body WILL compensate by tossing and turning to relieve those three problems.
: Hard mattresses can be good for back sleepers. However, most people have tight hip flexors these days from 21st century life (sitting), and so raising your legs a bit can help improve comfort.

dunno, lots of information here, but seems that he's sceptical of almost all interventions except for free running sleep?
takeaways
- circadian and homeostatic components must be in sync?
- circadian is actually closer to 25 hours??
  but he claims that factors like intense morning light, work, exercise can reset the oscillation to 24?? how??
  : The clock is reset in the morning with activity and bright light.

  hmm
- caffeine fine in the morning (latest after siesta nap?)
- very anti-alarm
- melatonin: can slightly advance the sleep phase, but won't be "sleep on demand"
- melatonin: impacts sleep structure?
- melatonin will affect creativity and alertness? shouldn't be used on regular basis?

:  Alcohol is a depressant.  Your body tries to counteract the depressant by releasing stimulants.  Alcohol wins the race so you go to sleep.  However, your body processes the alcohol out of your system and you are left with the (longer-lasting) stimulants, which is why you wake up earlier.

: Anecdata: Have sleep apnea, so am interested in better sleep, and I'm hooked up to a CPAP machine which registers every breath I take. I've tried several devices (withings, 2 garmin smart watches and a fitbit), and quite frankly, the results have been appalling.
: Some random observations:
: * My latest garmin has an "SpO2" sensor. Which is basically a random number generator with red LED. When I compare the results with an actual on-finger SpO2 monitor, there is zero correlation.
: * Both the fitbit and the garmins have mistaken masturbation for deep sleep. You would think that the wrist movement would be a clue to not being asleep, but no. Deep sleep.
: * The deep sleep vs REM classification seems to be based more on time-of-day than on anything else. Apparently I always start my nights with a block of deep sleep, followed by an alternating pattern of light & REM. This is true even when I'm awake during this "deep sleep" malarky.
: * My CPAP, on the other hand, is very useful for telling apart sleep & waking. Breathing rate becomes much more steady when asleep. I can see when I woke up, even if it's just for a few seconds while I change position.

: I volunteered to do a sleep study at the famous Stanford Sleep Clinic some 15 years ago hoping that they would tell me I’m superhuman and don’t need sleep. They came back and told me that I sleep very poorly.
: CPAP machines are (finally) wonderful, but the manufacturers don’t share any of the data that their machines collect other than basics like hours slept. For those of us with the intellectual curiosity to actually double click on your sleep numbers, Mark’s work is invaluable. I have over 1,500 nights of sleep logged in Sleepyhead...I learned the perils of drinking wine with dinner, the value in tucking in at the same time every night, and which masks work best for me—just to name a few benefits.
: I use sleep medicine to improve my life, the same way that I use a screwdriver to tighten screws—which is to say, I pay no attention to the sleep-apnea forums and I suspect most users are the same. I’m sharing all of this here in case Mark by chance frequents this forum—and hopefully if enough others like me discuss the value that this free product creates every night for so many millions of users, he may reconsider. I for one, would gladly pay for a Sleepyhead subscription if that meant continued support.
