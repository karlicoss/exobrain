: Риск того, что в результате эксперимента ружьё выстрелит и участник умрёт, составляет 50 %. Если копенгагенская интерпретация верна, то ружьё в конечном итоге выстрелит, и участник умрёт.
: Если же верна многомировая интерпретация Эверетта, то в результате каждого проведенного эксперимента вселенная расщепляется на две вселенных, в одной из которых участник остается жив, а в другой погибает.
: В мирах, где участник умирает, он перестает существовать. Напротив, с точки зрения неумершего участника, эксперимент будет продолжаться, не приводя к исчезновению участника.
: Это происходит потому, что в любом ответвлении участник способен наблюдать результат эксперимента лишь в том мире, в котором он выживает. И если многомировая интерпретация верна, то участник может заметить, что он никогда не погибнет в ходе эксперимента.

: Asiking since I feel like this particular example doesn’t answer yet “why bother using quantum computing for that”? In essence, here we just multiply initial state by the evolution matrix, which is a trivial task for classical computers (when the size isn’t exponential).
: For instance, when justifying use for Shor’s or Grover’s algorithm it’s easy to understand the speedup since the problems are fairly abstract and it’s clear how compexity grows with size. Wonder if in a similar manner, it’s possible to come up with some made-up system of N electrons (or other particles, if it would make Hamiltonian simpler/closer to reality), that would be relatively easy to solve analytically (or just reason about qualitatevely), but straighforward construction of Hamiltonian matrix would be infeasible? And then once could map the Hamiltonian onto quantum gates and that demonstrate that the results predicated by quantum computer match the analytical solution.

: Re: “macroscopic” properties, this seems to me to be closely related to a concept in the natural sciences call “renormalization group flow”, and possibly some ideas from cybernetics.
: One could imagine the space of states “flowing” through an app, and the macroscopic ones are those which are the most stable under perturbations (and therefore most ideal for getting strong understanding and building structure on top of). IMHO, the problem with conventional CS is how much it’s digital i.e. conditionals and cases and expects exact states, whereas good systems (to model the real world) might look much more analog in how they can marshal a variety of states into a set of well-defined ones.

:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-01-11]
:ID:       prblmssmblngdtfrmp
:END:

api allows retrieving messages before certain timestamp, from newer to older
can you prove that it's not possible to assemble data in some memory efficient and consistent way?

e.g. if we had oldest to newest, it'd be possible to 'extend' both ways, thus persisting middle bit
with one way we have to keep track of and merge 'segments'

** binary search? E.g. artificially make 'oldest to newest' by reverting query results
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** another approach
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       nthrpprch
:END:
say messages go from A .... Z  -- oldest to newest'
fetch: K --- P ; interrupted
so you've got some middle chunk.
you can extend left bit  committing regularly
e.g.  G - K =>  G --- P
      B - G =>  B --  P
 etc.

Right bit, however, is more trickly. You'll always have to commit *in a single transaction*

Otherwise you might end with a gap after P you'll never close

It's actually ok if you run often enough. But if you don't run for a year and want to carry on, it's gonna be quite annoying.


I guess one option is --refresh mode? go from the very end, ignore beginning and just fill it

* TODO [#C] some thoughts on before= API vs after= API   :api:social:exports:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-01-11]
:ID:       smthghtsnbfrpvsftrp
:END:

I'd never imagine I'd be coming up with theoretical puzzles involving APIs... but here I am.


Say you've got an API serving messages (say, <= 10 at a time) from newest to oldest.

In addition you've got optional 'before' parameter:

- fetch() -- gives 10 latest messages (TODO this one isn't even necessary?)

- fetch(before='31 Dec 2019 23:59:59') -- gives 10 latest (ish) messages in 2019


Now imagine you want to persist all messages in the database and TODO properties

- assumptions on resiliency -- say you experience cosmic particles every minute that reboots your computer. So you can't keep messages in RAM/database journal for too long
- assumptions on data transfer?

- assumptions on RAM -- not sure if necessary, basically bounded by ram/s ans seconds of uptimes?

- assumptions on catching up -- i.e. you want to progress in terms of ??? e.g. for each n, amount of messages <n unavailable decreases with time?



If API was different (TODO maybe even mentioning newet to oldest isn't important). can always sort.

- fetch(after=XXX)
- fetch(before=XXX)

allows for fairly easy


[oldest ... newest] -- persistent in db

loop:
   oldest, newest = query_db()
   extra_old = fetch(before=oldest)
   with db.transaction():
       db.insert(extra_old)
   extra_new = fetch(after=newest)
   with db.transaction():
       db.insert(extra_new)

TODO in fact, even easier. if we only had after (assuming we could use 0 timestamp),  then

loop:
    newest = query_db() # always assumes
    if newest is None:
	newest = 0
    extra_new = fetch(after=newest)
    with db.transaction():
	db.insert(extra_new)


the question is -- what's fundamentally wrong with 'before' api that makes it so hard? am I onto something deeper?

hmm so I guess your body could be 10^9m long and it wouldn't matter because you can only see past signals anyway (and you'll cross the event horizon faster?) basically your body _is_ your lightcone, so the side doesn't matter, and the mind is pointlike (in GR you either have the same observer, or _different_, and it's kind of discrete in that sense)

I wonder what it means for a distributed system of neurons as it's passing through the events horizon though? Although it'll have a local update limit (irrelevant to speed of light, more of signal propagation rate), wonder what it would sense
