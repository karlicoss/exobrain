#+TITLE: ⭐ Prepping
#+filetags: prepping

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism][Prepper]] is someone "who actively prepare for emergencies, including possible disruptions in social or political order, on scales from local to international".

This word (and 'community') often has somewhat a bad rap for many reasons, but nevertheless it's a useful concept.

For me however it's mostly about being more resilient in general.
Even though we should make sure the doomsday schenarious of different kind don't happen in the first place, thinking and preparing is important since
it simplifies our 'dependencies' and makes us and our infrastructure more resilient even in calm times.

: we need a new word as an alternative to "prepper" --- which is associated with a flavor of extreme independence and often paired with
: conspiracy theory (ie hoarding silver)
: owning more guns than you can carry
: and (frequently) lack of actual practice (ie stashing 500 lbs of flour without understanding it goes bad, or knowing how to really bake)

: For the past several decades the complexity of technology has continuously outpaced our ability to understand and replicate it from a first principles understanding.
: Not only does this leave humanity itself vulnerable to an outage of the internet or the global supply chain, it also harms our ability to understand the core technology of our civilization and violates the philosophical principle that civilization itself should have ownership of the building blocks which form it.
: Civboot gives humanity a place to start over -- to rethink how technology should be built from first principles as well as a place which can be improved for the benefit of all.
: 
: A Civboot is a civilizational bootstrapper, meaning it contains all essential components necessary to build and improve itself using only knowledge and tools contained within itself. In other words, it is the set of tools and knowledge necessary to design, modify and build all components that modern civilization depends on such as computers, motors, machinery, metals, electronic displays, buildings, air conditioners, energy generation, energy storage, etc. It must be able to achieve this using only raw materials, human involvement and the tools and knowledge contained within itself.
