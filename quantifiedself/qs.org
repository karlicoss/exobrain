#+title: Quantified self
#+filetags: qs

Why? It's fun (at least subjectively).
I'm trying to work on objectively useful things (diet, exercise, sleep), and quantifying keeps me motivated to to more research and get rigorous understanding of how body works.

: For me that's nice, but it's a bigger deal to me personally that I already have Postgres and SQL experience that translates directly to TimescaleDB, I don't have to learn a new tool and query language. Development is complex enough and I have to learn too many things as it is. The older I get the less enthusiastic I am about adding something new to the stack.
