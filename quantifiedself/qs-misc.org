: Its a recurring problem in my project ideas where the dataset involves subjective attributes.


: For example, one my ideas is creating a software that collects data about your personal day(hours slept, food eaten, medication taken, physical exercise, etc etc) and success metrics(money earned, how productive you are being, fat loss/muscle gain, etc etc) and give the user the correlations between the success metrics and the data describing the days, so the user have a 100% empirical and domain-blind feedback on what works for them. Kinda like what [this](https://medium.com/@mikebechtel/i-tracked-every-single-thing-i-ate-for-a-full-year-here-are-10-quick-a-has-2c259dd2f57b) guy did, but nicely packaged into a single software.


: Then theres a lot of attributes that are too subjective(specially some of the success metrics), so having a consistent and methodical way of collecting this data would be useful. Also I have no idea if someone is working on something similar, would love to read some papers/articles about it so I can mature my ideas, see what works and what doesn't.

: here was no single formula but one principle that comes up a lot is to change the difficulty of the test dynamically based on the user’s accuracy, to reach a steady state of some fixed accuracy, and apply Bayesian estimation to the parameters of interest. For example, in Digit Span we estimate the level in which the user would get exactly 50% of the trials correct. The reason that our verbal learning test doesn’t use a fixed number of items is that some people would find 10 items too hard and others would find 30 too easy, so any fixed number would waste a lot of their time testing them at an inappropriate level.

:  I love data. I love technology.  I love running.  I've got a crap ton of available data on virtually everything having to do with my running/health.  I have a high end Garmin watch, I run with my heart rate strap w/ Garmin Run Dynamics, I have a Stryd power meter, i used to track my HRV every morning, etc.
: 
:  And it's almost all useless.  The more I've run, the more I've realized how little of it really matters.  Sure you can track your progress any number of ways.  My favorite, RE ratio (basically the amount of running power required for a given pace) very cleanly shows how much my efficiency has improved over long periods of time, but I can also look at long run pace for a given HR, resting HR, implied VO2Max, etc. etc. etc.  Or I could just look at old fashioned race times and see how they compare.
: 
:  Almost all of this data is descriptive (and sometimes it isn't even meaningful) and it's almost never prescriptive.  The value of descriptive stats is minimal, beyond perhaps for some ongoing motivation to see improvement at regular intervals in the absence of races.  I really think tracking your mileage, pace, perceived exertion, and interval/workout details (when relevant) to be the key factors that are necessary.  It really doesn't take much to collect and track those.
: 
:  So much of the data collected has false precision (just because a number is being spit out, doesn't mean it has inherent meaning or is accurate), and even more of it is useless without very detailed context.  Heart rate is the best example of this: the temperature, humidity, wind, your fatigue, whether you're sick, what you're wearing, if you had caffeine, if you ate before running, if you had a few beers the day before, etc. will all massively impact your HR on a given run.  Not to mention that people really need to know their max hr, min hr, vo2max hr, and lactate threshold hr for zones to have any meaning... and almost no one knows these numbers.
: 
:  I have my training plan, and nothing really changes what i'm going to be running on a given day beyond how my body subjectively feels.

: Collagen is the main building block of connective tissue.  When the collagen in your body begins to dry out and age, you lose flexibility.  Hydrolyzation is the process of breaking protein molecules into smaller ones.  This makes them more bioavailable and better absorbed into your joints and connective tissue.  Studies have shown this to be far more effective than other supplements such as glucosamine chondroitin and MSM.  I take 1-2 tablespoons a day before bed with extra small peptides that make it more effective.

:  Most food tracking apps have the ability to retrieve nutritional info via text search, barcode scan or recent favorites. Barcode search never works offline but typing search and 'favorites' do in some apps. Only a handful of apps have time stamping. I have three options:
:  Write code over OFF or USDA database using Automate, IFTTT or Waistline. The database may be out of date but it will never cease to exist, require internet or spy on user. Unfortunately this will require lots of work. Waistline just added a few useful features.
:  Pay 40$ per year for mfp. Chronometer without offline logging is useless in too many cases. I would be willing to pay 40$ for this product but not 'per year' partly because its guaranteed to change or even die at some point. So no, not really.
:  Or just use bitesnap. This would be the easy choice, but OFF database is way more detailed and I am afraid of Terminator models with better food identification algorithms.
:  'y' means Yes, has feature. 'n' means does not. ' ' is same as 'n'. 'p' means feature requires membership. 'w' means the feature exists but is not as good as a 'y'. '?' means I do not know.

: Endomondo uses an equation that is a curve fit from data found in the paper "Prediction of energy expenditure from heart rate monitoring during submaximal exercise."  If you read the paper, they use heart rate, gender, age, and weight to calculate energy expenditure, and the correlation coefficients are...OK.
: Make sure that your weight, age and gender are accurate.  That should eliminate any vast variability in the equation.  At that point, if your HR is still way off what you would think is normal, it could be that you are one of the outlying points in their curve fit and that it'll never be that accurate.  100 ca/mile is a pretty solid average for easy exercise.  If you are running super hard, it could be more.
: If you can upload your data to a Garmin account, they use 'FirstBeat' which DCRainmaker claims is accurate within about 10%, and you may be able to get a more accurate approximation there.

It is not designed for all day use, just for HRV training and balancing out your mood.
:  I also bout the Lief from Lief Therapeutics, Getlief.com, and only used it a couple of times. It is a wearable that sticks under your chest and tracks your HRV all day long.  When it senses your stressed it will vibrate to notify you; then it will vibrate in a pattern to breathe in and out to relax.  It's a pretty cool device but costly at $280.
:  I also pre-ordered the Oura ring, this to will track your hrv all day long.  I don't have any experience with it, but I'm excited to see something called the readiness score.  This score will tell you when your system has recovered from exertion.  I am 35 years old and play basketball; my body doesn't heal like it used to.

I just got into law school with a massive scholarship, in which I need to do very well to continuously receive. This is good news, but I have been smoking weed nearly every day for 8-10 years at this point (and a lot of other related experimenting) and it can be hard to focus, and I sometimes have very bad brain fog.

I got the most expensive [intranasal light device](https://vielight.com/product/vielight-810-infrared-brain/) that they offer for $500 and I don't see any detailed reviews of the product so I figured I'd give it a go. Not everybody can afford that price tag so I figure I should give back to the community. I'm using a throwaway not because I'm a corporate advertising agency but because my main hobby is arguing with people on reddit (mostly alt-right/lite people) and I don't want them to have any personal info of mine, even minor stuff such as me being a pothead.
:  I don't fully understand the science behind it because I'm not so familiar with the terms, but it seems legit. From what I figured out, it shoots a laser up your nose. That laser gives your brain nutrients much the same way that the sun gives us nutrients through our skin. That said, I will be focusing on the effects that I notice on myself, not on the device. I remember reading somewhere (amazon review?) that 20% of the people that try it don't notice anything, so I hope I'm not part of that, or that the placebo is strong enough. I will also be making some changes in my lifestyle, which will hopefully act in tandem with the vie light.

: I tracked my hike this year with my Garmin Fenix 3.so I really can only talk about my experience of this male and model. (We even confirmed this with my girlfriends Garmin Fenix 3 too)
: I used UltraTrack mode.
: What I found out is that even this watch was super inaccurate! It did track the GPS and it looks good on the map. But the distance was always off. ALWAYS. It didn’t matter which tracking mode I used or option for GPS or Glonass (I hear the new watches have some new type of GPS type connection which may improve results.
: When I say the distance was off you would suspect maybe due to the tree density and the being obscured from direct line of sight would lower the stats but I found it was the opposite. From day one to the last it always made the distance over what I actually did.
: Some was due to when you’d stop for water and forget to pause and the GPS would ‘wonder’ within a radius. This would happen again if you stopped to take off a jacket or break for a rest. Now I hear you say, put on an auto pause feature. Now this works while running and cycling etc where there is an obvious difference in speed. But walking, at times can be painfully slow! Sometimes miles take a while, especially when it’s rocky and steep or muddy etc etc. It’s almost impossible for that feature to work.
: Now I used my battery pack that I carried with my stuff anyway to charge (roughly every 2 days) so that side never bothered me. I’d typically charge it when I got to camp and take it off charge by bed time. It charges super quickly so even if I forgot I could charge it at lunch.
: Now to be fair, other than it over estimating the mileage. It tracked my steps, my time walking, my time sleeping, I would have it set to give me a warning to eat and drink every hour or two. It would tell me my altitude and elevation gain and loss and predict weather patterns based on barometric changes. Its waterproof to more than anything even the Appalachian river can throw at it and more rugged than anything. Etc etc etc.
: You have to remember to start and stop it every day! I’m anal and so in my whole time it ran out of battery once while walking. Forgot to be stopped at the end of the day a few times.
: If I could change anything I would have liked to have tested it out before in similar conditions but I have used that watch for everything else from triathlons to snowboarding so thought it would be accurate as there.
: I would have also liked to have something like the Fenix 3HR or the new Fenix 5 with the new satellite options and HR monitor built in. Purely so I could track that and see my heart rate to know if I was pushing to hard but mainly I’m a stats geek!
: As for your other options I would say it would eat through your phone battery faster than you can eat 3 snickers bars. Don’t bother with a solar panel. So many of the people I knew with them sent them home.
: I have my stuff on Strava if you would like to see.
: Edited to add more information!

: At the risk of deviating too much from the original question, it’s good to consider the physical requirements to track HRV. Tracking intervals between heartbeats requires a significantly higher sampling frequency than tracking regular heart rate (typically over 250hz!). This is a significant drain on battery.
: 
: The battery drain is why most consumer wearable devices opt for tracking HR instead of HRV. And the ones which track HRV typically track it in a limited fashion (only occasionally at night, only on-demand, etc.)

: Before you spend a lot of money, check to see if this is something that your smartphone can handle.  GaiaGPS is available for both Android and Apple products, and for the $20 it can make your average phone do most of (but not all) of the things that a handheld GPS can do.  You'll get the benefit of a large screen, an easy to use interface, loads of free maps that you can set up in layers, and an active user community that can help you out.  Depending upon your phone, you may have battery life issues, issues with water resistance, issues with durability, and so on.  I use my MotoX Pure for casual day hiking and shorter trips, but not for longer trips for reason I'll explain below.
: 
: If all you're interested in is creating a GPS track (and not navigation) then your phone plus any one of the many free GPS tracking tools out there will do the job too.
: 
: If you are still interested in a dedicated handheld GPS I would suggest Garmin brand products.  I've been using an eTrex 30 for 4 years now for longer trips (over 2 days) along with the free  maps from [GPSFiledepot](http://www.gpsfiledepot.com).  I went with the eTrex over the more expensive Garmin units mainly because of size-it weighs around 4 oz.  By using Energizer lithium AA's I can get up to 35~40 hours continuous runtime, which is good for 3~4 days of hiking.  This includes not only making a track but also using it for navigation too.  The big downside to the eTrex units is the small screen.  Good points besides the exceptional battery life is ruggedness combined with being totally waterproof-I can (and have) used it all day long in the rain and can't count how many times I've dropped it.  The eTrex 30 has been replaced with an upgraded model but mine still works fine and I can't see any reason to replace it yet.

: (resistance 8) Power = 0.023 * rpm * rpm +14.7.
: The number of observations at level 4 was much smaller, so the regression had a poor R^2 = 0.971.
: (resistance 4) Power = 0.0066 * rpm * rpm + 10.6

: tl/dr here:


: 1. Exercise is a Heckuva Anti-Depressant.
: 2. Sugar & Salt hangovers: Nearly as bad as alcohol hangovers.
: 3. Two Days of Bad Sleep in a Row Will Mess. You. Up.
: 4. Weight Loss != Fat Loss
: 5. Carbs aren't evil. But they're... sneaky.
: 6. 15% body fat (for a guy) is doable with tasty food. 10% requires you to eat fewer tasty things. 5% requires you to forgo taste (and friends) entirely.
: 7. Muscles recover strongest 2-3 days after a workout, and stay stronger-than-baseline for about 2-3 days after that. Beyond that, wimpy-ness resumes and you atrophy. (Which is why consistency is key.)
: 8. Food Scales are your Friend. Casseroles, stews, and buffets are your Enemy.
: 9. Processed foods are easiest to track (because they have SKU's) but not as good for you. Whole Foods vs. Whole Data.
: 10. Standard McDonald's Cheeseburgers are, as far as I can tell, the most nutritionally complete food on a macronutrient-per-dollar basis.

:  Received my ring last Friday. Had the 1st gen but returned it due to inaccurate sleep readings. Unfortunately, the new ring seems to be inaccurate for me as well. Both rings read that I was asleep when I was meditating, laying awake in bed, or even making coffee. Since the Readiness score is based in part on the Sleep score that’s inaccurate, too. I contacted customer service last night, no word back yet.
: The new material of the 2nd gen ring feels cheap and plasticky, although a better size and weight than the 1st gen. Overall, so far, not impressed. Especially after waiting over 9 months. But I look forward to my initial impressions changing for the better with continued use. Would love to hear from other Ōura users as well.

:  What is the most detailed effort to create a "life-system" to map out (and "optimize") human life in accordance with various values, much like you might do in an RPG or "The Sims" or some other video game?
:  As for visualization, I imagine something with colorized 3-D graphs, and many graphics, all of which allow you to optimize your life. The "Quantified Self" movement might have elaborate graphics/dashboards to this effect.
:  I would be especially interested in how values were balanced against each other--like a "utilitarian" formula, though I'm probably using that term wrong.
:  Eating chips is an "ITM" value to me. The pleasure is "in the moment" (ITM) and then the pleasure vanishes. Working out at the gym gives ITM pleasure, but it also gives ATC ("around the clock") benefits to your life by making you feel/function better. So I would be fascinated to see how any "life-optimization" system would balance ITM vs. ATC values, especially since the former seem dominant in our society (spectation, junk food, etc.) and the latter seem to have so much to recommend them in terms of total value.
:  Various values could be "optimized" and balanced within a personal "life-system," including ITM vs. ATC values. A "Type A" person might want to all but extinguish "ITM" values, and focus obsessively on ATC values.
:  Also, the system might be able to coerce you to make sure that you serve the interests of your future self, even though the present self might be too lazy/unmotivated to pursue the future self's interests. This is Orwellian, but it might be highly effective, and it's something you sign on to, and it's something that serves the future self. The system could give away some of your money or do other punishments if you ever eat chips (for example) or do something against your future self's interests. In a sci-fi world, the system might even be able to shock you like we shock dogs with shock-collars, but that's more extreme. You would sign on to this system weekly, or something, so it would represent your voluntary desires when you are in a state of peak reflection, rather than your momentary whims/instincts/cravings.
