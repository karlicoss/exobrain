Software must eat the world, there is just no other way.
How can we make it more powerful, intuitive, pleasant to use?

: What do I mean by “better”?
: Computing aids and encourages humanity’s noblest pursuits: science, reason, art, philosophy.
: Computing directly supports improving the mental health, physical health, prosperity, and happiness of all humans.
: Computing help us master (or at least, doesn’t intensify) our problematic tendencies: addiction, status anxiety, socioeconomic divisions, tribalism, fear, hate.
: The economic and intellectual horsepower in Silicon Valley and the wider tech world seems to be pointed away from these goals.
: For example: algorithms designed to maximize watch time, the social media outrage machine, loot boxes and other psuedo-gambling, and smartphone notifications activating Skinner-box tendencies.

: Which is exactly why I prefer formal query languages over NLP queries. In both cases (at least with most state of the art NLP techniques), you have to learn certain patterns and ways to phrase a query so that the system will reliably understand it. With formal query languages, these patterns are well-defined, can be looked up and will most likely not change significantly (so there is value in memorizing them). With NLP systems, the patterns are completely opaque, you have to learn them through trial and error, they may change anytime (e.g. because the model is retrained) and they are usually significantly less powerful.
: I sometimes feel that the trend to prefer NLP over formal query languages is comparable to the trend to prefer GUIs over consoles in the 80ies and 90ies.

: Some things that work really well that are often hard in native GUI toolkits:
:     You can zoom pretty much any content as large or small as you like. Doing this in native UI involves either editing obscure config files, or mucking about with the system’s DPI settings (not easy to zoom per-app or changing zoom levels depending on mood or screen you’re using).
:     More cross-platform than pretty much anything else.
:     Open anything in a new context (tab or window).
:     Copy/paste anything.
:     Search any text with e.g. Ctrl+F.
:     Back button.
:     Modifying anything easily; even if you’re not doing this directly yourself this has huge benefits in the form of e.g. some simple bookmarklets, or your adblocker.
:     Unlike desktop applications, everything is sandboxed. If you think persistent tracking and fingerprinting on the web is bad: it’s even easier on the desktop. Something like hash(/etc/passwd) should do the trick to generate a persistent unique device ID.
:     Very compatible; the first website: last modified somewhere in the early 90s still works in your Firefox or Chrome today.

: The point is really that lenses are values that represent locations in a data structure. And, as values, they can be combined, transformed, serialized, etc etc. Imagine having a type that represents a chain of method selectors, and that gives you some idea of the purpose.
: The fact that method selectors only appear very rarely as first-class values in most languages means that most people aren’t tuned in to scenarios where they could be applied. But I bet you’ve invented special cases of this yourself, when you had a function that needed to dig data out of one of several locations, depending on other inputs.

coolest thing in the second part, he talks of his desire to give creators better tools as part of his idenitity. basically, it hurts him when he sees creators struggling, when ideas can't be born. he sees injustice in that (similar to my trip experience!)

: I really can't be arsed with this stuff any more.
: Why are the developers at Google acting in such boneheaded ways? Is it literally just "I get paid loads of money, lol"? Do people not grow out of that eventually when they have enough?
: Like, you're literally a developer. Why would you make something you wouldn't want to use? Is the company just wholly made up of people who actually don't care about computing?

: Wikipedia is even pushing further forward on that vision with Wikidata, a general-purpose knowledge base that's perhaps the most successful example of such a thing, succeeding where many other efforts have failed dismally. (Already, Wikidata gets more edits per minute than Wikipedia, albeit much of the activity is performed by bots.) It's also a successful use of Linked-Open-Data and Semantic-Web technologies (the Wikidata site hosts a SPARQL endpoint, for general queries of all sorts), so while it might not be "Old Web" per se, it feels quite retro-futuristic in many ways.

: And of course, all the well-known personal assistant AI's rely on it quite a bit, although they're not eager to advertise that fact.

: Even Firefox dropped it's built-in RSS support by now, so for the current September generation, this is meaningless, unfortunately. Still, as infrastructure, it's very important, because it's simple to transform RSS into other formats: JSON feed, h-feed[^1], etc.
: As for how to "follow" (I'd prefer to use subscribe instead) a personal site these days, it's a hard problem, reasonably well documented here: https://indieweb.org/follow
: There is a current effort, called microsub[^2] to tackle the problem, but it's new, and is not user friendly enough at all.

: desktop computing had core skills that could be developed, that would apply across different programs.
: on mobile systems, the balance of power feels very different. apps are each their own immersive experiences, each picking their own widgets, toolkits, styling, paradigms. many apps are a thin shell over far off closed services we could not understand if we tried.
: mobile has been a very advanced war on general purpose computing. the value of understanding the os, understanding "computing" has gone way way down in this far more black boxes environment. the user has been treated like an idiot, protected endlessly from themselves, and the technical underpinnings deeply deeply masked over.
: computing is being destroyed, especially on mobile. the desktop is one of the few places one has any chance to learn about computing in any meaningful way.
