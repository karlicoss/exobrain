  : The entire block is primarily presented frozen in time, on June 23, 1975, just before 8 pm, moments after the death of Bartlebooth. Nonetheless, the constraints system creates hundreds of separate stories concerning the inhabitants of the block, past and present, and the other people in their lives. The story of Bartlebooth is the principal thread, but it interlinks with many others.

: People curious to know more about these kinds of things should be aware that there’s a large literature on these topics. A sort-of-okay-ish book on related topics is Handbook of Individual Differences in Social Behavior. It covers a wide variety of ways in which different people behave differently or interpret behaviour differently. One of the main things I learned from that book is that there are a lot of ways in which people are different (many more than I’d have thought), and everybody will likely have a lot of ‘blind spots’ in terms of these things because there are just so many ways in which people vary that it’s very difficult to spot all of them and keep them in mind, even if you know about their existence.

:   I would be careful about _Distress_, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...
:   _Quarantine_ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.
:   ["Riding the Crocodile"](http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html) and _Incandescence_ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of _Schild's Ladder_ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.
:   ["Dust"](https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt) and _Permutation City_ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in ["Crystal Nights"](http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/).

: Я "джва года ждал" (с) ее выхода. Когда эта книга уже была готова, и до выхода оставалась пара дней, автор выпустил серию своего подкаста, где за пару часов практически пересказал все содержание, может даже еще лучше, чем в самой книжке. Рекомендую ту серию послушать, она взрывает мозг и делает это несколько раз. В книжке у него примерно все то же, но более подробно. Последовательно излагается многомировая интерпретация (MWI), показывается, почему она самая простая и прямая. Что это "суровая квантовая механика" - что получается, если брать чисто формулы и их предсказания за содержание, не добавляя никаких дополнительных постулатов вроде коллапса волновой функции, различия между квантовым и классическим мирами и т.п. Недавно широко известная в узких кругах теорфизики Sabine Hossenfelder сперва похвалила эту книжку Кэрролла, а потом отдельным постом попыталась объяснить, в чем ее претензии к многомировой интерпретации, но у меня так и не получилось ухватить ее мысль, даже после некоторых ее уточнений в комментариях

И скажу вам, это лучшая книга, что я вообще читал/слушал в этом году, и может быть не только в этом. Книга не топит ни за одну конкретную интерпретацию (в отличие от явного эвереттиста Кэрролла), не дает окончательных ответов (увы), зато очень здорово рассказывает историю развития взглядов, идей и интерпретаций за последние 115 лет. Все основные персонажи - Планк, Эйнштейн, Бор, Гейзенберг, Шредингер, фон Нейман, Бом, Уилер, Эверетт, Белл, Дойч, Zeh, Zurek и пр. - показаны очень живыми и конкретными людьми в конкретных исторических событиях, видно, как их идеи не возникали из воздуха, а рождались в интересной борьбе на фоне других важных событий, часто не относящихся напрямую к науке.

: 
: The Network Revolution – confessions of a computer scientist (1982)¹ is the title which immediately springs to mind. I never see anyone else mention this book, but I liked it. One of the many interesting things it contains is an anonymized telling of what happened with Doug Engelbart and why, even after giving the dazzling “The Mother of All Demos”², the SRI company did not succeed in its grand plan for the future of computing.
: 
: It also talks a lot about very early Internet history, and gives the history of many things which I have not seen others reference, like Lee Felsenstein and Community Memory.

:   Previously I have enjoyed "Stories of Your Life and Others" and well as the new "Exhalation: Stories" both by Ted Chiang. Thought those were both great as well, and at this point I've come to appreciate short stories much more than I used to, so I was wondering if there is more like this out there, or if there is any short story collection that is dear to your heart that you could share with me?

: 
: Both books are worth reading; Hubbard's influence on FAIR is noticeable and positive. FAIR has the advantage that it comes with a fairly built-out ontology for assembling data or estimates. The OP touches on the top level (Loss Event Magnitude and Loss Event Frequency), but the ontology goes quite deep and can be used at multiple levels of detail.

: By contrast, fish do not have any neural architecture unique to the consciousness-related parts of the brain and are probably unable to feel fear or pain in the way a human would – we strongly encourage you to read this article in full to convince yourself of this claim. Although fish show pain-like responses to harmful stimulus and do so less if given painkillers, this is true even when the entire telencephalon (which includes the forebrain) is removed so on balance it is unlikely they are having a qualitative experience to accompany that response.

There must be such boson variables connected with electrons..."
