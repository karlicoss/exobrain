This in my public todo-list, so it's constantly changing and things are moving around.

I also maintain a [[https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22191391-dima-gerasimov][goodreads profile]], where I rate/review books.

  : The entire block is primarily presented frozen in time, on June 23, 1975, just before 8 pm, moments after the death of Bartlebooth. Nonetheless, the constraints system creates hundreds of separate stories concerning the inhabitants of the block, past and present, and the other people in their lives. The story of Bartlebooth is the principal thread, but it interlinks with many others.

: From the Preface:
: Many of the scientific treatises of today are formulated in a half-mystical language, as though to impress the reader with the uncomfortable feeling that he is in the permanent presence of a superman. The present book is conceived in a humble spirit and is written for humble people.

: People curious to know more about these kinds of things should be aware that there‚Äôs a large literature on these topics. A sort-of-okay-ish book on related topics is Handbook of Individual Differences in Social Behavior. It covers a wide variety of ways in which different people behave differently or interpret behaviour differently. One of the main things I learned from that book is that there are a lot of ways in which people are different (many more than I‚Äôd have thought), and everybody will likely have a lot of ‚Äòblind spots‚Äô in terms of these things because there are just so many ways in which people vary that it‚Äôs very difficult to spot all of them and keep them in mind, even if you know about their existence.

:   His best books for me are _Schild's Ladder_ and _Diaspora_. The first chapter of _Diaspora_ was originally published as a short story and is available online as ["Orphanogenesis"](http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/01/Orphanogenesis.html).
:   I would be careful about _Distress_, the first chapter was really disturbing and it doesn't lighten up all that much. It's really good, just, pushes boundaries about personhood and bodily integrity. And of course has an underpinning of weird physics, like always...
:   _Quarantine_ - there's like three or four stories in this one, all entangled together. The primary arc really plays wicked games with the Copenhagen Interpretation, taking it way literally.
:   ["Riding the Crocodile"](http://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/00/Crocodile.html) and _Incandescence_ take us to a galaxy that's as far beyond the world of _Schild's Ladder_ as they are beyond us, but where people are still people no matter how much of what defines us has become optional.
:   ["Dust"](https://archive.org/stream/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07/Asimovs_v16n08_1992-07_djvu.txt) and _Permutation City_ combine strange physics and strange computational neurology in odd ways. A large part of the story involves an experiment that Egan later decided was horribly unethical, and he returns to it with a whole different viewpoint in ["Crystal Nights"](http://ttapress.com/553/crystal-nights-by-greg-egan/).

** TODO [#C] This is one reason I was glad to come across Reframing Superintelligence: Comprehensive AI Services As General Intelligence by Eric Drexler, a researcher who works alongside Bostrom at Oxford‚Äôs Future of Humanity Institute. This 200 page report is not quite as readable as Superintelligence; its highly-structured outline form belies the fact that all of its claims start sounding the same after a while. But it‚Äôs five years more recent, and presents a very different vision of how future AI might look.

: 
: The Network Revolution ‚Äì confessions of a computer scientist (1982)¬π is the title which immediately springs to mind. I never see anyone else mention this book, but I liked it. One of the many interesting things it contains is an anonymized telling of what happened with Doug Engelbart and why, even after giving the dazzling ‚ÄúThe Mother of All Demos‚Äù¬≤, the SRI company did not succeed in its grand plan for the future of computing.
: 
: It also talks a lot about very early Internet history, and gives the history of many things which I have not seen others reference, like Lee Felsenstein and Community Memory.

Thought those were both great as well, and at this point I've come to appreciate short stories much more than I used to, so I was wondering if there is more like this out there, or if there is any short story collection that is dear to your heart that you could share with me?

: @Plinz: It is as if Chaitin, Solomonoff and Schmidhuber had never lived. Chaitin explains incompleteness as a problem of data compression:  proving means compressing a statement to its axioms. This requires an algorithm that gives a result in a finite time.

: Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (1966): Much of this book deals with quantum mechanics in curved space-time.
: Lectures on Quantum Field Theory (1966): This book lays down the foundations of quantum field theory using the Hamiltonian formalism.
: Spinors in Hilbert Space (1974): This book based on lectures given in 1969 at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, USA, deals with the basic aspects of spinors starting with a real Hilbert space formalism. Dirac concludes with the prophetic words "We have boson variables appearing automatically in a theory that starts with only fermion variables, provided the number of fermion variables is infinite. There must be such boson variables connected with electrons..."
: General Theory of Relativity (1975): This 69-page work summarises Einstein's general theory of relativity.
