: I like the idea of converting a calendar into a diary / life log by integrating different data layers.
: Other layers I'd like to add:
: • Locations (Google Maps, Swarm)
: • Media consumption (books, Netflix)
: • Browser history / Screentime
: • Stress levels (Oura, Apple Watch)

: I think I want to create some sort of community chat on the topic of knowledge management and tools around it, with the emphasis on interoperability, malleability, owning your data, local-first, org-mode etc.
: Anyone would be interested to join?

- [2020-05-27] likely needs to be [[Zulip]] (or even better, [[Matrix]] when they support threads in Element?)
- [2020-06-30] [[discord]] sucks
  - ok, discord is a bit crap because lacks proper threading
  - need to sign up to read & search it
  - closed source
- [2020-06-18] I think I want the focus on existing tools and setup rather than discussing mockups and vague concepts. both are important, but I want to build something now
- [2020-06-18] I want it to be a space to discuss configuration, and get detailed technical help etc. So needs to be more like an IM chat, with fine grained topics (so you can steer off a discussion without spamming everyone)
*** [2021-01-04] sadly haven't had time to set up something so far, also wouldn't want to spawn more communities with large overlap

A huge downside of discords is that you can't engage with the information (e.g. search) without joining first.

** TODO [#C] [2020-10-07] eh, would be really nice to have some sort of memex at this point :promnesia:memex:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       wdhwldbrllyncthvsmsrtfmmxtthspnt
:END:
maybe it could have some basic core (e.g. with couchdb), and then used in different apps?
e.g. promnesia uses it to jump and browse the history
dashboard uses to display all events
timeline -- similarly for all life events
