1. L, R : sets of games, then G = <L, R> is a game
2. DGC: no infinite sequence of games G^i = <L^i, R^i> with G^(i+1) \in L^i \cup R^i for all i \in N

L and R are left and right options of G.

G = {L_1, L_2, ... L_n | R_1, R_2 ... R_m }

Conway induction: ICGN. 0 satisfies automatically.
Proof: infinite sequence of games not satisfying the property, contradiciton.

Conway induction implies DGC

Finitely many positions: short

Same moves: impartial game


Abelian group:

1. 0 = {|}
2. G + H = {(G^L + H) \cup (G + H^L | (G^R + H) \cup (G + H^R)}
3. -G = {-G^R | -G^L}

The set of all Conway games forms a partial order with respect to the comparison operations:

1. G=H. If the second player to move in the game G-H can win (G and H are equal).
2. G||H. If the first player to move in the game G-H can win (G and H are fuzzy).
3. G>H. If Left can win the game G-H whether he plays first or not (G is greater than H).
4. G<H. If Right can win the game G-H whether he plays first or not (G is less than H).


A basic theorem shows that all games may be put in a canonical form, which allows an easy test for equality. The canon
ical form depends on two types of simplification:

1. Removal of a dominated option: if G={{L_1,L_2,...}|G^R} and L_2>=L_1, then G={{L_2,...}|G^R}; and if G={G^L|{R_1,R_
2,...}} and R_1>=R_2, then  G={G^L|{R_2,...}}.
1. Replacement of reversible moves: if G={{{A^L|{A^(R_1),A^(R_2),...}},G^(L_2),...}|G^R}, and A^(R_1)<=G, then G={{{A^
(R_1^L)},G^(L_2),...}|G^R}.

G is said to be in canonical form if it has no dominated options or reversible moves. If G and H are both in canonical
 form, they both have the same sets of left and right options and so are equal.
