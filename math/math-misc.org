Alternatively one can think of Riemann sheets whereby on crossing a branch cut
one moves onto a different Riemann sheet of the function; the number of branches equals
the number of Riemann sheets. This allows closed contours to be formed by going around
branch cuts as many times as required to get back to the original Riemann sheet. However
although this scheme is very elegant, for calculational purposes it is best to treat branch
cuts as barriers one cannot cross.

A harmonic function is a function whose value at a point is always equal to the average of its values on a sphere centered at that point (reference). This is why they show up as steady-state solutions to the heat equation: if this averaging property weren't true, then heat would be flowing either from or to a point.

In mathematics, the tensor product V ⊗ W of two vector spaces V and W (over the same field) is itself a vector space, together with an operation of bilinear composition, denoted by ⊗, from ordered pairs in the Cartesian product V × W into V ⊗ W, in a way that generalizes the outer product. The tensor product of V and W is the vector space generated by the symbols v ⊗ w, with v ∈ V and w ∈ W, in which the relations of bilinearity are imposed for the product operation ⊗, and no other relations are assumed to hold.

Consider the statement "a continuous function preserves closeness". That means if f ( x ) f(x) and f ( y ) f(y) are close to each other then x x and y y were close to each other originally.

In analysis, a function is continuous if you can make the image in the codomain as small as you like, by choosing a small enough part of the domain.

This analogy is a backport from computer science back to geometry, and a bit was lost in the translation. In CS, for open, read "verifiable", and for closed, read "non-verifiable". Termination of blackbox programs is a verifiable property: if someone gives you a program and tells you it halts, then if they're telling the truth, if you wait you'll eventually see the machine stop and know they told you the truth. Nontermination is non-verifiable: no matter how long we wait, we can never be sure that the program won't halt soon, and so we can't verify we were told the truth. –

: When p-value is used it's because you are attempting to test a hypothesis of some sort. So let's first define a hypothesis. At its simplest, a hypothesis is an attempt to explain some observation (generally by linking it to other observations). To keep things simple, let's say that you have observed that every time a cat gives birth, you've also observed that the babies have been kittens. You therefore attempt to explain this with the following hypothesis: "When a cat gives birth, the resultant offspring will be kittens." We'll call this "H1" for hypothesis number 1.
: Now, in statistics (and by extension, science in general) there is never just one hypothesis. There is your hypothesis AND there's something called the Null Hypothesis. The Null Hypothesis states that there is actually no relationship between the observations you're trying to link. In our example, the Null Hypothesis would state: "There is no relationship between pregnant cats and kittens." We'll call this "H0" for hypothesis number 0 or, null hypothesis.
: But what's the point of having a null hypothesis?
: Aside from math (as far as I know) nothing we know about the universe is absolute. All that we know is based on observation, and since we can't observe everything that there is, we can't say with complete certainty that any explanation of an observation is "true." However, we can say that any given hypothesis has a higher or lower probability of being true than other hypotheses. Through beating as many alternative explanations as possible, we can increase our confidence that our successful explanation is true....but we can't ever say that it is 100% true. This is called inductive reasoning and it is the basis for all that we think we know about the universe.
: Back to our example of pregnant cats and kittens. Because we understand the limitations of inductive reasoning, we know that we can't ever prove 100% that a pregnant cat will always give birth to kittens (maybe on some far away planet cats give birth only to snakes). However, we can at least show that our hypothesis (H1) has a higher probability of being true than the null hypothesis (H0). In other words, we can say that there is a high probability that there is at least some relationship between pregnant cats and kittens.
: So, we start tracking every cat birth that we possibly can. Each time a cat gives birth we mark down whether the offspring is a kitten or something else. Once we have a good size of observations, we run the result through a statistic called "p-value" or "calculated probability." The number that comes out at the end is the probability of getting the same results if the null hypothesis is true.
: In our example, let's say we observed 100 pregnant cats. All 1,000 births resulted in kittens. No snakes, no turtles, no balls of anti-matter. Just kittens. Rather than doing all the math we'll just say that our resulting p-value is 0.01. This means that there is a 1% chance that all 100 pregnant cats gave birth to kittens and yet there's actually no relationship between the two. The p-value doesn't say that your hypothesis is correct, and it doesn't say the null hypothesis is incorrect. The p-value merely states the probability that you could get the same results as you observed due to random chance.
: Typically in science we consider a p-value of 0.05 to be significant. Meaning that unless the probability of getting the same results due to random chance is 5% or less, we generally don't pursue the alternate hypothesis and instead either continue looking for something better or stick with the null hypothesis: the observations are unrelated.

: It's not significant with respect to your a priori cutoff value, so it is not significant. All these terms:
: approaching
: marginally
: trending toward
: are incorrect interpretations, as you have no idea what would happen if you were to collect more data (e.g. p could be 0.09 after collecting additional cases, so how can one justify saying that 0.055 is approaching significance?).


- .
: A p value is not a statistical analysis or a test, it is the outcome of a statistical test. One of the issues in relying on p values is that there are a lot of different ways to get to a p value, and not all of these may be appropriate (this is sometimes called torturing, submitting data to various statistical tests until something comes up significant).
: The other point to make here is that we don't prove or disprove hypotheses. We can reject the null hypothesis and provide support for the alternate hypotheses, or we can fail to reject the null hypothesis and find, well, not much.
: So, what does a p value mean?
: Let's use an example. Say we are interested in testing a new drug to treat depression. One good way to test this is to get a big group of depressed individuals and to give them either this new drug or a placebo. Before doing this, we measure their level of depression on the Fictitious Depression Inventory (FDI). Before giving them a course of our new drug and placebo, our two groups have rather similar FDI scores:
: Drug: 44.2 Placebo: 46.7
: We then give them the appropriate pills (double blind and randomised, of course). After, say, eight weeks of this, our groups don't look as similar anymore:
: Drug: 36.7 Placebo: 42.4
: Both have improved in their depression scores (as frequently happens, depression improves over time). We run some statistics on our two groups, and we find that the two groups are different, with an obtained p value of 0.038 (this is usually written as p = .038). This is smaller than our critical value of 0.05 and we can conclude that there is indeed a difference between our groups as a result of the drug being better at lowering FDI scores than a placebo control.
: So, what does this all mean? Well, there's two important things here. One is the meaning of the null hypothesis, and the other is the meaning of p = .038.
: The null hypothesis states that the difference between the two groups we have is not real. Any difference that we see in those numbers is just because of chance or sampling or something else, because that difference does not exist in the population. What we are working with is a sample, we have a small group of depressed individuals relative to all the people in the world who are depressed. We want to know if what we see in our sample applies to everyone else (the population). If the null hypothesis is true, it says that, yeah, okay we have a difference in our sample, because our two numbers are different, but this difference is just noise or something else, it's not about the pills. When we reject the null, we say that the difference we see in our numbers is not due to chance, and we infer that this effect exists in the population.
: So what is the p value? The p value is a way for us to formally acknowledge that there is some risk that we are wrong when we say the null hypothesis is false. Specifically, the p value is how likely we are to see the two numbers we're seeing (or another two numbers that different from one another) if the null is true. The cutoff that we have all accepted is at most 5% chance of accepting a result when the null is in fact true (p < .05). Why 5%? Well, when Fisher developed the idea of null hypothesis testing, he threw number out as an example and people kind of ran with it.
: What are the issues with null hypothesis significance testing? Well, one big one is that it dichotomises thinking. Everything ends up being significant or not, when there is a little more finesse in there. The other issues, closely related to this, is that people misinterpret the p value so that a smaller p (say 0.0001 instead of 0.001 or 0.049) means that your experiment worked better. This really isn't true. You can get a "really significant" finding that really isn't important. Going back to our fake example from above, say your groups looked like this:
: Drug: 36.8 Placebo: 38.4
: If this effect comes out to be "highly significant" (p = .0013), it doesn't mean that the results are all that important because the difference between the two groups is so tiny. The drug did have an effect, but it didn't really help people much with their depression. And given the side effects that drugs can have, and the cost, you're probably better off in the long run in just taking that sugar pill.
: This dichotomous thinking has other downsides. It forces people to push for significance when maybe that's not the best thing given the data. You can slice a data pie in many different ways, and eventually you may be able to get a significant result, but perhaps not one that is meaningful or that will replicate.
: Whether or not you get a significant result is also dependent on the sample size you're working with. Running experiments is very laborious, and it's in everyone's benefit to test the least number of participants to give robust findings.

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/31867/bayesian-vs-frequentist-interpretations-of-probability
: The snag is that we have to introduce the prior distribution into our analysis - this reflects our belief about the value of p before seeing the actual values of the Xi. The role of the prior is often criticised in the frequentist approach, as it is argued that it introduces subjectivity into the otherwise austere and object world of probability.
: It might also be good to mention that the gap between the frequentist and Bayesian approaches is not nearly as great on a practical level: any frequentist method that produces useful and self-consistent results can generally be given a Bayesian interpretation, and vice versa. In particular, recasting a frequentist calculation in Bayesian terms typically yields a rule for calculating the posterior given some specific prior. One can then ask "Well, is that prior actually a reasonable one to assume?"
: You're right about your interpretation of Frequentist probability: randomness in this setup is merely due to incomplete sampling. From the Bayesian viewpoint probabilities are "subjective", in that they reflect an agent's uncertainty about the world. It's not quite right to say that the parameters of the distributions "change". Since we don't have complete information about the parameters, our uncertainty about them changes as we gather more information.
: A Bayesian may say that the probability that there was life on Mars a billion years ago is 1/2.
: A frequentist will refuse to assign a probability to that proposition. It is not something that could be said to be true in half of all cases, so one cannot assign probability 1/2.
: Frequentists posit that the probability of an event is its relative frequency over time,[1] (3.4) i.e., its relative frequency of occurrence after repeating a process a large number of times under similar conditions. This is also known as aleatory probability. The events are assumed to be governed by some random physical phenomena, which are either phenomena that are predictable, in principle, with sufficient information (see determinism); or phenomena which are essentially unpredictable. Examples of the first kind include tossing dice or spinning a roulette wheel; an example of the second kind is radioactive decay. In the case of tossing a fair coin, frequentists say that the probability of getting a heads is 1/2, not because there are two equally likely outcomes but because repeated series of large numbers of trials demonstrate that the empirical frequency converges to the limit 1/2 as the number of trials goes to infinity.


https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/ywrba/eli5_bayesian_statistics/
:  Bayesian statistics rely more on computational simulations and have become more common because computers have become much faster. A lot of people are put off by the fact that you incorporate prior believes into your estimate of the "truth", but you can use non-informative (vague) priors like in the example above (each possible outcome gets equal probability) and in any case with a lot of data your priors will become less important.
