One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable. Such a manifold is called differentiable. Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives.

Here are classic models of the projective plane: 
- The set of vectors of R^3 with the natural topology
- A (real affine) plane completed by a projective line (line at infinity)
- A sphere where the antipodal points are identified
- A closed disk where the antipodal points of the circumference are identified

@zariskitopology So "compact" doesn't mean "small": it means "doesn't have any fuzzy edges".

** [2016-06-18] compactness
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cmpctnss
:END:
- usual axioms of real numbers: forall a, b: a + b = b + a, forall x, y. exists z. x * z > y, so on
- add constant eps
  - infinite number of axioms for each n: eps < 1/n
  - eps > 0
for each finite subset of eps axioms there clearly is a model with \bbR
for infinite set: no model with \bbR as domain! Nonstandard real numbers, hyperreals

** [2016-06-20]  connectedness
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cnnctdnss
:END:
Connected: can't be represented as a union of two disjoint open sets.
Locally connected at x: for every open V(x), there is connected open U(x) \subset V(x). X is locally connected if locally connected at every point.

Local connectedness and connectedness are unrelated!

Path connected: there is a path joining every pair of points.
Locally path connected at x: for every open V(x), there is connected open U(x) \subseteq V(x). X is locally path connected if locally path connected at every point.

Simply connected: path-connected and fundamental group is trivial.
Locally simply connected: admits a base of simply connected sets. Also locally path-connected and locally connected.

f_n -> weak(*) f if forall x. f_n(x) -> f(x)
How to develop intuition abut the open sets?

f_n converges weakly to f if it converges pointwise

f_n converges weakly to f:
forall O(f). exists N. forall n > N. f_n \in O

What is O? finite number of points do not converge?

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       hsdrffspcs
:END:
Hausdorff if any two points can be separated by neighborhoods (diagonal is closed in product topology).

Space X is Hausdorff iff its apartness map

\ne : X x X -> S
(x, y) -> { x \ne y }

is continuous


Space is discrete if every singleton is open (or if its diagonal is open)

Space is discrete iff its equality map

\eq : X x X -> S
(x, y) -> { x = y }

is continuous
