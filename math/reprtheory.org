: In quantum physics and quantum chemistry, each set of degenerate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator comprises a vector space V for a representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, a "multiplet", best studied through reduction to its irreducible parts. Identifying the irreducible representations therefore allows one to label the states, predict how they will split under perturbations; or transition to other states in V. Thus, in quantum mechanics, irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the system partially or completely label the energy levels of the system, allowing the selection rules to be determined.[5]

A representation of a group is a way to think of its elements as operators, and this is what we need to understand symmetries in quantum physics.

** [#B] [2019-01-10]  Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge q at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy E1=qV1 and destroying it released E2=qV2, which would seem natural since qV measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, qV2-qV1, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, qV2-qV1. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation {\displaystyle V\rightarrow V+C} V\rightarrow V+C, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules E1=qV1 and E2=qV2 for the energies of creation and destruction would allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge q at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is {\displaystyle V} V and {\displaystyle V+C} V+C respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.[1

Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a fixed amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a varying amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinde  

In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, general relativity states that gravitational fields have energy, and special relativity concludes that energy is equivalent to mass.

ams for b. than, for a + b just take N = N_a + N_b and 


ahh ok. path is a function from [0, 1] to space, s.t. p(0) = start, p(1) = end
right, so p_a(0) = 0, p_a(1) = a; p_b(0) = 0, p_b(1) = b; 
then p_(a+b)(t) = p_a(t)  + p_b(t). p(0) = 0; p(a + b) = a + b; the mapping is continuous since group operation is smooth

ok, looked up the answer. it's pretty trivial; connected space is connected under a cont. map; since conjugation is continuous, it maps onto a connected space. since it maps identity into identity, that connected space is G_0.
eh, I'm an idiot. actually, my path approach does solve it, just literally notice that p_b(t) = g p_a(t) inv(g) is a continuous map connecting 0 with some point.

in trivial topology, all points seem close; however when mapped to discrete, they fall apart
in the same sense, the function is not continuous if two points that seemed indistinguishable end up in topoplogically distinguishable sets
e.g. step function that is 0 if x <= 0 and 1 if x > 0:
0 is not distinguishable from eps > 0. However it gets distinguished by the image space topology.
so, take the open set in Y: S_Y = {0}. its preimage S_x is (-inf, 0]. it's not open. what's the proplem with that?
take any larger open set T, containing S_y. its image is Y = {0,1}. or maybe even a sequence of open sets? they all get mapped to Y. But there will be a sudden jump to just {0} in the limit

in terms of closure, it's a bit easier. 0 is close to (0, inf). however f(0), which is 0 is not close to closure({1}), which is {1}.

preimage of (-a, 0): infinite union of Union_k (k-a, k)
preimage of [0, b): infinite union Union_k [k, k + b)
regrouping, we get infinite union Unkion_k (k - a, k + b); which is an open set.
ok, boring, we get the original topology

Every component is a closed subset of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the rational numbers are the one-point sets (singletons), which are not open.

ok. so manifolds are locally path connected and connected components of locally connected space are also open.

I haven't read the mechanics book you mentioned, so I don't know how similar these are to that, but some good books I've used that go into representation theory outside of particle physics are Hamermesh's Group theory and its application to physical problems and Petrashen's Applications of group theory in quantum mechanics.

I am a math student and I like seeing the narrative of math applied to physics. I am reading through Georgi's "Lie Algebras in Particle Physics" now, and chapters 1.16 and 1.17 use representation theory to easily characterize the normal modes of a quirky system of springs and blocks.

I once read through the book "Solved Problems in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics" by Gignoux & Silvestre-Brac, and it helped me see the non-pure side of the symplectic dynamics/variational calculus I was learning. I really liked this applied section in Georgi. I never saw these techniques in undergrad physics and I find it really cool. Do you know of any other sources that go through specific examples/calculation problems in physics and apply representation theory?

: I have to agree with functor7 that representation theory comes up everywhere. I think it's rather exciting from a basic level too.


: Studying finite groups, you might think the prime object of study is permutations: to understand your group, you look how it acts on some finite set, by permuting elements around. However, it is quite tricky to get all the information you might want from it.
: Another very profitable way to understand your finite group is to let it act, not by permutations, but by linear transformations, on a vector space instead of just a set. This is a representation. You lose a bit of information this way, but you usually can end up saying so much more. The key is to understand the irreducible representations. For instance, the order of the group is the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the different irreducible representations of the group. Much more can be said, of course.


: What's amazing is that this approach generalises to so many other contexts.
: You can do representation theory of Lie groups. For instance, representation theory of the circle group (group of unit norm complex numbers) encodes Fourier series, and you can vastly generalise this to Pontryagin duality, Peter-Weyl duality, and beyond (automorphic representations...).
: You can do representation theory of Lie algebras, and this is the essential ingredient in the classification of semisimple Lie algebras (say over the complex numbers).
: You can do representation theory of rings. This is just the notion of a module over a ring, which comes up everywhere in commutative algebra!
: You can do representation theory of quivers. This is really tantalising: you start with a collection of dots, and arrows between the dots. A representation of this consists just of a vector space for each dot, and for each arrow a linear map between the corresponding beginning and endpoint vector spaces. It sounds silly, but is an incredibly powerful tool.
: And so on, and so on...


: Another very powerful tool is to look at categories of representations. Given for instance a finite group G (but it could be any of the other things representations makes sense for), you kind of reverse the construction I did for quivers. You put a dot for each representation of G, and an arrow for each linear map between representations which respects the actions (a so called intertwiner). You forget everything else, so you don't remember how the group acts on each vector space, you just have a dot instead. This is the category of representations of G, and it's very interesting to see its structures, and whether you can figure out the group knowing just this category. For many interesting reasons, it turns out you can't. However, this category has subtle extra structures; for instance you can take tensor products of representations. If you remember this tensor product structure explicitly (which comes down to remembering explicit associativity isomorphisms [; (A \otimes B) \otimes C \cong A \otimes ( B \otimes C) ;]) then you can actually recover the group! It's quite a fantastic statement really, when you realise it seems like we forgot so much about the group and are just looking at a collection of dots and arrows!
: This point of view explains things like what the character table of a group does and does not see, and explains why you can't recover the group from the character table.

:  Really all of QM depends on representation theory. Take a potential, and find all the operations \(rotations, inversions, etc.\) which leave it invariant. For example, take a potential from 3 protons in an equilateral triangle. There are 6 'covering' operations: Rotation by 60/120 degrees with the axis of rotation normal to the plane of the triangle and 3 180 degree rotations about axes in the plane of the triangle. This is the [Dihedral Group D3](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DihedralGroupD3.html). Like any group, it is closed under multiplication of the elements, where in this case multiplication AB is defined as applying operation B then applying operation A. So a multiplication table can be made that show every possible product in the group.
:  As of now, the elements of the group are just operations. Representation theory is writing a set of matrices  homomorphic to the group, where each matrix represents a particular operation. In this case, this means the matrices must obey the multiplication table of the group. Keep in mind that setting all matrices to the scalar 1 forms a representation for any group, because If you need to satisfy AB = C then 1\*1 = 1. After a bunch of math, group theory tells us that there are a set number of possible representations with different matrix dimensions \(all square\). At the end of the day, we can define all operations which leave the Hamiltonian in QM unchanged as the group of the Schrodinger equation \(this is the same as saying the group of all operations which commute with the Hamiltonian\). The KE operator has no effect on the symmetry, so we can just look to the potential for the operations which leave the hamiltonian invariant.
:  Suppose we have some state psi that satisfied H psi = E psi \(the time\-independent Schrodinger Equation\). Act on this equation with one of the operations in the group of the Schrodinger equation. Then RH psi = R E psi, which means H \(R psi\) = E \(R psi\), so \(R psi\) is a new eigenfunction which has the same energy as the original. We can continue with all operations in the group to find all the degenerate wavefunctions corresponding to the eigenvalue E. This set of N wavefunctions \(N is the number of elements in the group\) forms a basis for an N dimensional vector space now. We know any wavefunction in this invariant subspace can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors, so we can see how R affects each of the basis functions we have chosen. In the terms of linear algebra, R now becomes a transformation matrix that turns the constituent basis vectors into whatever the operator changes them to. These transformation matrices actually form a representation of the group of the Schrodinger equation \(which I haven't proved\). These representations are unique up to a change of basis \(equivalent to a similarity transform\), so this means each possible eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian 'belongs' to a certain representation of the group of the Schrodinger Equation.
:  Remember that there can be many representations of the same group. Take our D3 group. Representation theory tells us that the only possible representations \(up to similarity transforms\) have dimensionality 1, 1 and 2. Well these representation matrices are the same ones that just came up in the description about the representation for each eigenvalue. From this, we can clearly see that we can only possibly have states with either no degeneracy or a degeneracy of 2 \(remember the dimension of the matrix dictates how many basis functions we need\). Also remember that each eigenvalue has its own representation, so different eigenvalues of the same Hamiltonian can have different degeneracy. This information can be found before we even begin to do calculations involving the Hamiltonian, so that's really nice.
:  Now, going back to this vector space where we defined basis functions for the degenerate space, we have a convenient way to characterize the state. First we give the eigenvalue, which we commonly label by ordering the eigenvalues from smallest to largest and using it's place as the label n. Now, we have a set of degenerate functions corresponding to this label n, but we can apply a 2nd label \(call it 'l'\) to each basis function. Well now we can uniquely label any eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with the labels \(n,l\). These are known as quantum numbers, which you've most likely heard in relation to the hydrogen atom. The 3 'p' orbitals are the basis functions for a 3\-dimensional vector space of eigensolutions, and they are generated by applying rotation operators which are in the group of the Schrodinger equation. There's some extra subtlety here, because there is also an s orbital which is degenerate to the p orbitals. Normally, if the degeneracy cannot be explained by symmetry then it is known as an 'accidental' degeneracy, but Fock showed that there is actually a set of operations in 4\-D which exploits the symmetry. The hydrogen potential has the group O\(4\), and you should be able to understand most of the language in the introduction [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2100327?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). With something like Hydrogen, we actually end up factoring the full group into direct product groups which commute with each other, so we can further simplify the quantum numbers.
:  Obviously molecules have symmetries arising from their shape, so we know what kind of representations their energy levels must correspond to. By applying a perturbation like an electric field, we can couple different energy levels together which may belong to different representations. Since the perturbation itself will have its own representation within the group, we can use these determine which transitions are allowed by symmetry \(usually called selection rules\). I haven't really given any of the details on why this happens here, but it's an important use. This is how we interpret the results we get from spectroscopy.
:  Crystals are another place where group theory/representation theory is really important. You have a unit cell of atoms which has some group of operators which leaves it invariant. Then you put it in a lattice, so now we have an infinite number of group elements corresponding to translations by the lattice constant \(in the appropriate directions\). As long as the unit cell \(point group\) lattice is 'compatible' with the lattice, the space group of the crystal can be formed by taking all possibly combinations of operations. We can write the general operation as {R|t} where R is some generalized rotation \(coming from the unit cell symmetries\) and t is a translation \(coming from the repetition symmetry\).
:  For now let's just look at the group of the translations, and only in one dimension for simplicity. Pick any eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. We know that the wavefunction\(s\) corresponding to this eigenvalue must be a representation of the group of the Schrodinger equation \(the translation operators\). The group is a cyclic group generated by the element Ta, where Ta is a translation by one 'unit cell.' Cyclic in this case means any general T = Ta\^n for some n. These groups are obviously Abelian since every element will commute \(Ta always commutes with itself and every element is Ta\*Ta\*...\*Ta\).
:  Well another group theory fact I left out is that there are as many representations of a group as there are conjugacy classes. The conjugacy class of an element A is XAX\^\-1 for all X in the group, repeat this for every element in the group and discard any repeats and you get all the classes.  This means we have a representation for each operator. These classes are way more important than they may have seemed from what I've previously written, because you'll often see groups written in terms of their character table, where character is defined as the trace of the representation matrix. Group elements in the same class will have the same character, this can be pretty easily seen since A and B being in the same class means XAX\^\-1 = B for some X. Well now just think of that instead as matrices, which is what we are doing in our representation. This corresponds to a similarity transform \(notice these showed up before as well\), and it is easily proven that elements connected by a similarity transform have the same trace.
:  Back to a 1\-dimensional crystal: Clearly each element in an Abelian group forms its own class because the X and X\^\-1 will commute through the A and cancel out, so each element will only generate itself. Crystals actually have a finite number of elements, so the way we have stated the problem the operators won't form a group because they aren't closed under Ta\^\(N\+1\), where we have 'walked off' the end of the crystal. So to simulate the effects of an 'infinite' crystal, we use periodic boundary conditions and suppose that the end loops back around to the beginning. So now we have a nice cyclic group of N elements with N representations since each element forms its own class. The laws of group theory also fix the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the representations to be equal to the number of elements in the group, so this fixes each representation to be one dimensional, or in other words each representation is just some scalar. Say that in a particular representation the generating element Ta is written as r, so r\^N = 1 by the periodic boundary conditions. So r = exp\(2\*pi\*i\*p/h\), where p = 1,2,3 ... h. But since psi must belong to a representation of the group, we must have Ta psi\(x\) = psi\(x \+ a\) = exp\(2\*pi\*i\*p/h\), and we eventually find that any function satisfying these conditions can be written as u\(x\)e\^\(ikx\), which is the very important Bloch Theorem. My derivation here doesn't have all the explanations, and I skipped the entire process of relabeling p to k, but I actually have to go so maybe I'll come back later and fix it.
