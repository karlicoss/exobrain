: Sooo you’re walking around a virtual world and your mind is being blown. Eventually you’re going to want to reach out and interact with it. The Myo controllers are your in-game fine motor skills. 

hmm could use it for kinda mouse? that'd be pretty cool, basically controlling mouse without moving hands from the keyboard

Maybe make an online game where you have to guess the radius (you can leave markers)
Basically the idea is you can mark the pole and walk around it
Kinda binary search!
