Spaced repetition lets you memorize things with very small (or to be more precise, pretty passive) cognitive effort.


Personally I haven't paid much attention to specific algorithms and formulas. There is some research out there claiming superiority of one over another, but I feel like as long as it's exponential backoff, that works for me.

* [2017-11-01] anki vs supermemo                                  :spacedrep:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       nkvssprmm
:END:
: Basically what you have said. Everything are disadvantages but maybe the algorithm. However, I think Anki's algorithm is based on Supermemo's algorithm, it is just that it is not based on the most recent but Anki's and Supermemo's are very similar. There is no reason why someone would use Supermemo instead of Anki. All that said, I use Supermemo and Anki, because I think the few free decks for languages Supermemo have are quite great and there is no way to export them so I use Supermemo with some of these decks but Anki for everything else.

: @michael_nielsen The analogy of supervised learning and spaced repetition I think is dead on. I've been referring to Polar as a "cognitive prosthetic".  My background is partly in machine learning so when I got into spacedrepetition I immediately realized it was supervised learning for humans.

- AnkiDroid -- kinda ok
- duolinguo: spaced repetition for language learning
  weird, goes straight into grammar, doesn't really explain anything, synthesised voice
- memrise: spaced repetition for language learning
  ok, good progress, but feels too easy occasionally, weird exercise suggestions sometimes.
- using org-drill after all
