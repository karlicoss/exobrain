hmm, wondering what happens to deadline when task completes?
display as 'postponed'? also for repeating tasks only
ok I need + cookie ,it's basically 'every'
ok, nice, when i complete the task, 'scheduled' goes away automatically

:  Hi all,
:  I recently posted a link on here about an org mode export template called [Imagine](https://jessekelly881-imagine.surge.sh/). I have been working on a new(and I believe much better) template recently called [Rethink](https://jessekelly881-rethink.surge.sh/). Yes, I know the name isn't the best.
:  So far they are just works in progress but I plan to create a smallish collection. I started this because I was looking for good css templates targeted at org mode and I was disappointed by the severe lack of them. Hopefully, someone will find these useful. Again, they are still wip but maybe with a little help from some helpful web designer we can make them much better.
:  Also, if you find any bugs or things you wish were different feel free to comment or contact me on [Github](https://github.com/jessekelly881). Thanks!
