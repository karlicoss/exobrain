: 1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.
: 2. It doesn't actually replace a USB drive. Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.
: 3. It does not seem very "viral" or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?

: GPL is copyleft, meaning you have to distrubute any derivative works of the original also under the GPL. If you use a GPL library in your project, that creates a derivative work of the library, and your entire project has to be licensed under the GPL.
: One exception: if it's the LGPL (Lesser/Linking GPL) then dynamically linking the library does not create a derivative and you're free to license how you want.
: One caveat: you can also license your work under annother license. As long as people can get it under GPL, that satisfies the GPL requirements, and you can dual-license with MIT, for example. People can choose which license to follow.

: If you ever distribute your program to someone, you must give (to this person only) the source code, and give full freedom to modify and distribute it under the same license.

:END:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40492518/is-an-import-in-python-considered-to-be-dynamic-linking
: No, loading a pure-Python module is not considered a form of dynamic linking.
: 
: Traditional dynamic linking loads machine code into a new chunk of memory, and multiple executable processes can be given access (the dynamically linked library only needs to be loaded once, virtual memory takes care of the rest). The linker connects the executable and the dynamic library at runtime.
: 
: Loading a Python module, on the other hand, loads the bytecode for the modules into the Python process itself (Python will compile the source code if no bytecode cache is available at this time too). The loaded modules are not shared between processes. No translation has to take place, the result of running the bytecode produces new objects in the Python heap that all existing code in the interpreter can interact with.
: 
: No linker is involved in this process, no separate memory, to the OS there are no separate sections of memory to be managed as the module is simply part of the Python process memory.

: The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just data; a free software license like the GPL, based on copyright law, cannot limit what data you use the interpreter on. You can run it on any data (interpreted program), any way you like, and there are no requirements about licensing that data to anyone.
: As for generic question about dynamic vs static linking. First of all, FSF's and Stallman's view is that it doesn't matter if linking is static or dynamic, GPL infects either way. From FSF GPL FAQ:
: If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means that combination of the GPL-covered plug-in with the non-free main program would violate the GPL.
: and
: Linking [name of your program] statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on [name of your program]. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination
: However, this is questionable from legal point of view. In the only case that actually went to court regarding dynamic linking — Galoob v. Nintendo — Court of Appeals ruled that derivative work "must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form". Which is not the case with dynamic linking.
: Anyway regardless if dynamic linking does indeed infect or not, there is work around. It's used for example by Nvidia to provide binary drivers for Linux. You create (L)GPL wrapper, but as author you are allowed to add special exception to link with specific closed-source. Vide FSF GPL FAQ.

: I do have a conclusion however: if you have a python module which is not GPL-compatible but uses the API of another python module covered by the GPL chances are you are fine if: (i) you are not taking away market share of the GPL module. And (ii) you are not derriving or extending the creative work or copyrightable content of the module. But there's no distinct line, common sense is your friend (and enemy).

: This is why we need answers

But well-meaning people can easily get bogged down in the morass that is license terms. To deal with this problem, the types of questions Jacob was asking yesterday need clear, common answers, many of which are not currently found in the FAQ documents of popular licenses (e.g., what exactly is “linking” in the context of a language like Python? If software is only used inside a particular company, is it being “distributed”?). Of course, any such answers would be subject to “until a court rules definitively one way or another”, but anything would be better than what we have right now.
