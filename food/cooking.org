- there is no such thing as too large stir fry pan
- cut stuff in really small chunks. probably no such thing as too small; you could just stop frying
- transfer fried things, dry with paper towel and use oil again

: Recipe and Ingredients:
: • 100 g shirataki noodles • 100 g steak of choice • 1.5 cups beef broth • Soy sauce • Egg • Cilantro • Leeks
: “First thing you’ll need to do is cook your meat, whichever way you like. Personally, I like to fry up the steak until about an internal temperature of 140 F, set it aside to cool, then thinly slice it. I totally recommend under cooking it a tiny bit, as when you set it aside it will still be cooking internally. Next I pour out some beef broth into a small pot and let it simmer, adding in some soy sauce and lime juice. Personally I add extra salt. Like very extra.
: Now for the noodles. I have discussed shirataki noodles in a previous post – from the preparation, to the nutrition facts. I will repeat – they contain almost no calories and no carbs! Now what I do is just drain them from their package and wash through intensely with cold water. I then just add them to a bowl.
: Top the noodles with your beef broth and get to decorating. Add in your meat, the egg, and top it off with chopped cilantro and leeks. And a slice of lime of course! It makes all the difference trust me.” (Taken from blog post)

: The most important aspect of a cooking oil is its resistance to destabilization from heat. Coconut oil has the highest stability of all tested oils due to its high saturated fat content.
: Processed seed oils are so fragile they cannot even be exposed to sunlight without going rancid.

- grapeseed/avocado/macadamia for high-temperature cooking.
  macadamia is great in salads too though!

It might impact taste, i.e. there is no point burning a fancy olive oil.
However, there aren't any proofs for the health risks
