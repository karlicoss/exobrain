#+title: âš« File sync software
Continuous sync of my data and information is a biggie for me.

- first, I've always had one desktop/big sturdy laptop and one small portable for travel/coffee shops/etc
- second, I need to be able to access information on my phone, when I may not have good network (or any)

Eventual sync (e.g. via Git) might be fine for personal wiki.
For todo-list or just random documents, however, I really don't want to have this overhead of thinking whether I need to do some extra work in order to sync.

I'm using it at the moment, and it works great.

pros:
- uses filesystem
- opn source, can be selfhosted
- decentralized, no need for 'main' device

cons:
- no web interface

on Android: [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.catfriend1.syncthingandroid][Syncthing-Fork]] is better than the original Android app.
  [[https://github.com/Catfriend1/syncthing-android#major-enhancements-in-this-fork-are][Some differences]]:
- "Battery eater" problem is fixed
- UI explains why syncthing is running or not.
- Individual sync conditions can be applied per device and per folder

I stopped using it in favor of Syncthing, info might be a bit outdated (circa 2019?). If you don't want

pros:
- uses filesystem
- has revision history, so you can restore deleted files

cons:
- apparently symlink handling is quite bad... http://www.paulingraham.com/dropbox-and-symlinks.html
  possible solution: do not point to stuff under dropbox directly, instead make a dir like dropbox-links and point there?

on Android: [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync][dropsync]] is nice


* TODO [#C] Nextcloud
:PROPERTIES:

It seems to be more like google services (docs/contacts/maps/etc) rather than just file syncing. Still haven't tried it myself though.

Nexcloud is a fork of Owncloud (the latter has gone enterprise or something). Apparently it's much more open source

pros:
- can replace google services #degoogle
  e.g. [[https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/maps][maps]]
- open source, can be selfhosted

cons:
- [[https://ownyourbits.com/2017/04/18/different-ways-to-access-your-nextcloud-files][can mount as a filesystem]], but it's not a primary interface
- centralized, requires a 'main' server
- ???

cons:
- symlinks doesn't work? (or WIP?)
- closed source
- centralized


* [#C] Seafile
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       sfl
:END:
Dind't end up using it, so in my understanding it's kinda like Dropbox?

pros:
- open source
- delta sync, headless, dedup, selective encryption

cons:
- not distributed, requires a running server

mm, only can access, can't sync as dropsync or syncthing would :(
use webdav syncer as a workaround? https://github.com/haiwen/seadroid/issues/502#issuecomment-286056463
