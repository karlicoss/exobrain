#+title: ⭐ Data exports & liberation
#+filetags: exports

I need data exports to build tools around my personal data, and the actual process of exporting it from a silo is the first step.

After I export it I use it to build a [[https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror]['data mirror']].

Here I mostly keep the notes about the data I haven't finished exporting.
The ones I have already/mostly finished are mentioned here:

- [[https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html][Map of my infrastructure]]
- [[https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html][What data on myself I collect and why?]]

:  {ids} can contain up to 100 semicolon delimited ids. To find ids programmatically look for user_id on user or shallow_user objects.
:  The sorts accepted by this method operate on the following fields of the question object:
:      activity – last_activity_date
:      creation – creation_date
:      votes – score
:      added – when the user favorited the question
:  activity is the default sort.
:  It is possible to create moderately complex queries using sort, min, max, fromdate, and todate.
:  This method returns a list of questions.

: Hi, Camlistore author here.
: Andrew Gerrand worked with me on Camlistore too and is one of the Upspin authors.
: The main difference I see is that Camlistore can model POSIX filesystems for backup and FUSE, but that's not its preferred view of the world. It is perfectly happy modeling a tweet or a "like" on its own, without any name in the world.
: Upspin's data model is very much a traditional filesystem.
: Also, upspin cared about the interop between different users from day 1 with keyservers etc, whereas for Camlistore that was not the primary design criteria. (We're only starting to work on that now in Camlistore).
: But there is some similarity for sure, and Andrew knows both.
