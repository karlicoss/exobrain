- this works... but doesn't if setup.py is guarded with __main__
  : import distutils.core as C; C.run_setup("setup.py", stop_after='config')

  could check for __name__ == 'builtins'... but then would need to modify all files, and might not reliably work
- can't just copy setup.py outside, because it might need .git directory for scm_version thing
  fuuck.
- adding to easy_install.pth works.. but need to figure out what's the base pkg directory...

: You know, because we knew this would be controversial we made sure it was both a compile-time option and a runtime option. Yes the upstream default of both defaults to on, but that's just upstream. We made it very easy and supported for downstream distros to switch between opt-out and opt-in of this option for their users. We have encouraged distributions to leave it on, but we were fully aware that for compatibility reasons this is something downstreams likely wanted to turn off, and most compat-minded distros did, as we expected.
: 
: Now I am used to taking blame for apparently everything that every went wrong on Linux, but you might as well blame your downstream distros for this as much you want to blame us upstream about this, as it's up to them to pick the right compile-time options matching their userbase and requirements in compatibility, and if they didn't do that to your liking, then maybe you should complain to them first.
: 
: (And yes, I still consider it a weakness of UNIX that "logout" doesn't really mean "logout", but just "maybe, please, if you'd be so kind, i'd like to exit, but not quite". I mean, that's not how you build a secure system. We fixed that really, fully knowing it would depart from UNIX tradition, but that's why we made it both compile-time and runtime configurable)

: But:
: * if Nix is already very niche, Guix is the niche of a niche. The ecosystem is tiny in comparison.
: * The Nix interpreter isn't exactly fast, but Guix (with it's scheme) was significantly worse for me, even in relatively small tests
: * The hard stance on open source requirements is understandable, given the projects origin, but it will severely hinder adoption. No, I don't want to package every commercial app I need myself. nixpkgs has almost everything.

ok, really good guide
- update remarkable
- ssh onto it
- follow toltec install https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec#install-it
- opkg install rm2fb
- opkg install remux  # launcher
  systemctl enable --now remux
  swipe up (on the right edge!), should show the menu
- opkg install koreader
- Create a file /home/root/.config/draft/02-koreader with the following contents
  not sure if really that necessary?
  : name=koreader
  : desc=Ebook reader
  : call=/opt/koreader/koreader.sh
  : term=;
- congratulations, you are done!
: Note that when a ReMarkable system update occurs you will likely need to re-run the systemctl enable --now remux command. I think this should be the only command needed to re-run, but I don’t have a system update to install to validate that.

: It does not support [0] (i.e. loses) extended attributes even between systems that share support for them, which in the case of macOS means no support for Finder tags, custom icons, legacy Mac fonts and countless other Mac features, maybe niche to most, but still important to those that make use of them. AFAIK it is not even in the roadmap.

: Ansible is a great system, with a terrible DSL.
: YAML is not a programming language, and deployment is not a toy task. You need power.
: The result is that ansible has pushed a markup language to its limit, then pushed the templating engine used in it to its limit too. Then used a bunch of duck tape + conventions to glue everything and ended up with 10% of an unclean verbose unexpressive real programming language with ridiculous limited tooling, testability and had to document + support it.
: As with most DSL.
: For what? For the quest of having something "declarative", and that any language could read.
: Well you can have declarative API written in any language, and nobody except ansible ever read playbooks.
: In the end, it's just a big weight at the ankle. I never ever used it and though, "damn, what a pleasant tech choice, I'm happy they didn't directly expose the API through Python".
: It's the same reason I use "nox" and not "tox", or "doit" and not "make". DSL really seem like a great idea, but they fail most of the time. There is a reason only few of them - like SQL, CSS or regex patterns - became a success. 99% of the time, what you need is a good lib, with a well designed API. For the 0.9% of the time you do need multi-language communication, you may implement RPC. Then, only for the 0.01% case should you really consider a DSL.
: But we geek love to create DSL. They are fun to write! They are so elegant in tutorials!
