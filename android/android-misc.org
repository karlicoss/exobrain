:  Easer defeated me. I screwed around with it for a couple of days tying to get it to disable mobile data when connected to wifi, but the 'event' and 'condition' and 'profile' system was just too damn confusing for me to get it to work.
:  There is no step-by-step tutorial or good explanation of how the app works that I could find, so I moved on to other software to solve my problem.

: Xiaomi phones are insane, at least BlackShark. They replace virtually all the major user level stuff of Android with extreme data collecting alternatives. They then make it so that you cannot disable many of them (via adp, custom ROMs etc.) without bricking the phone, I'm talking wallpaper or clock apps that run with full, non-modifiable privileges. They subsidize cheap hardware with truly insane level of tracking.
: They will also stop allowing custom ROMs once they've built up enough reputation, some newer models already will never have custom ROMs.

: The default su from Termux is simple. When run it brings /system/bin/sh for you instead of Termux's shell (typically bash). To solve this issue, you can install the custom su wrapper for Termux by

ok, this seems super useful
