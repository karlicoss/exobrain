: Reasons off the top of my why the majority of people don't take more action against dying.
: They think death is inevitable
: They believe in an afterlife
: Psychologically denial
: Doesn't seem relevant (for young people death may seem very far off, something that happens to other people but not them until one of their close friends die)
: They've never really sat for 5 minutes by the clock and thought about not existing

: The "shut up and multiply" aspect of spending $300/year (as Eliezer Yudkowsky quotes his costs for Cryonics Institute membership ($125/year) plus term life insurance ($180/year)) for a probability (how large being widely disputed) of obtaining many more years of lifespan. For this reason, cryonics advocates regard it as an extreme case of failure at rationality - a low-hanging fruit by which millions of deaths per year could be prevented at low cost.

: Alcor Foundation has two field cryoprotection kits located in England -- one with Cryonics UK and one in London. Last year, we successfully cryoprotected a young man in Bristol, despite lack of warning, and transported him to Alcor on dry ice for cool down to liquid nitrogen temperature. Contact diane@alcor.org for membership information, or read the membership section of the website.

: From my layman understanding, if you're ~20 years old you can basically just not fuck up super hard and wait another decade and we'll know a lot more. If you're 30, definitely start taking health seriously but maybe don't worry so much about downing 50 supplements that only have a bit of backing research. If you're 40 and above, and your goal is life extension... you might have to take a gamble.
