I spent a while ago trying to figure out 'exact' definitions of functional vs object oriented programming
Or exact formalisms for quantum mechanics
Or 'correct' ways of working with git
Or precise guides of composing music

but at some point you realise there is no right way once you understand things enough, there is a continuum.
There is no right way and often you can do great things regradless exact formalisms etc
need to develop this thought more and come up with more examples

: Time goes quicker as you get older because people get stuck in the same routine, and it is quite easy to compress memories together when you do the same thing every day. So, go explore, every day, even if it is just mental exploration through books or music, and time will surely slow down.

:  I hope this is relevant here since the blog itself is at the intersection of these two subjects. I'm aware there was a long thread about therapy recently, but this is a more specific question.
:  I've tried a few different therapists now in the attempt to find one who's right for me, and at least two have independently told me the same thing: that my mode of discussion in the therapy sessions is too "abstract". This tends to happen when I start talking about percentage probabilities, or how well a theory fits the available facts, or whether a causal chain has a weak link – in other words, what they call "abstract", I would call scientific or rationalist.
:  When I use language like this, I'm usually trying to clarify and evaluate some assertion they've made about how my unconscious works, or what is happening in my life, or whatever. ("You think you want X, but maybe really you want Y, and that's why you do Z" etc.) And I feel like, in some cases, when their hypothesis is analysed more rigorously, it's revealed as a bit strained or patchy – as in so many fields, a vague formulation makes a half-baked claim sound at least initially plausible.
:  I'm not trying to claim I'm "too intelligent for therapy"! (These therapists have stunned me with their insights sometimes.) Only that a rationalist approach sometimes helps cut through some of the fog – and yet therapists don't seem to welcome it much.
:  Is there a real conflict here? Is therapy – at least as it's conventionally practised in the English-speaking world – inherently wary of an empiricist mindset? Or do I just need to keep looking for a therapist who thinks the way I do? I assume that when Scott Alexander is seeing patients, he is open to this stuff!

First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe…
: 
: I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it’s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there’s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don’t understand how it subtracts.

very similar to my perception!
