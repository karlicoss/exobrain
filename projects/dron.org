For dron, thinking about it a year later, a large chunk of the convenience in this dron tool would probably be from
- allowing multiple services/timers in the same file (and then splitting them up in the actual systemd files)
- allowing a different format (something more yaml-like) to make it possible to align jobs vertically. Then it's even fine not to have a general purpose language -- much easier to keep copypasta if you can block edit it

what worked:
- systemd integration is excellent, can hack on systemd to experiment, and then reapply changes properly via dron
- while mailing is sort of hacky, don't think it has ever let me down
what didn't work
- barely used dron edit, mainly dron apply
what to improve:
- speed up dron apply?
- monitor too slow?
