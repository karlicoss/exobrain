gitbook has got nice almost realtime search but only supports markdown. also they are not open source?

https://github.com/qdot/org-gitbook -- weird thing, split my headings into different pages
had to package-install ox-gfm first
- [2019-12-02] dunno, maybe starting with single page with links dump (sorted by tags then date?) and that wouldn't even require index?
  ignore priorities at first?
- [2019-12-02] one simple thing to do would be just generating html pages (with normal emacs export?) and then running JS indexer against HTML pages? could do when blog is compiled
tedious to upgrade though, but a good start?
- [2019-12-03] maybe, display everything as a single page, then it's easy to search?

- repulsive force: charges (forceManyBody)
  - distanceMin is interesting (e.g. set to 1000000). pushes unrelated stuff far, but it ends up clumping
  - distanecMax -- if I lower it, it ends up clumping + some circular artifacts (although they might be intesting too!)
  - strenght: setting to something like -400 effectively has the same effect as default zoom? they are just a bit more spread apart
    ok, -200 is good enough
- attractive force: forceLink
  : return 1 / Math.min(count[link.source.index], count[link.target.index]);

  - defaultStrenght: low value makes it appear like a blob
  - defaultStrength: smth like 10 completely breaks the simulation?
  - changing min to max results in 'leafy' nodes pushed very far apart
  - adding Math.pow(count, 2) -- weird. I guess pow has similar effect and reduces the force effectively
  - changing distance to large values -- again, weird cicrular artifacts??
    I guess it's sort of an 'expected distance'? and at some point it's dominated by the repulsion anyway. default 30 is good enough

again, it's not that removing 'real' interaction is the point, so I'm happy to answer anyway. But it can lead the person to ask a more specific question, for example.

: There is certainly beauty in randomness.
: 
: How about an option which presents you a visualisation of a set of random connections in the daily notes (as a link to a new data visualisation page)? Maybe with options to turn on and off certain branches of thought (in cases you are working on something specific). This way you get your daily inspiration right in your daily notes (or you can turn it off if you don't like it).
: 
: Ultimately, it would be very unique if these random connections also generate a page with all block and page references to the visualised links. Basically you forgo the problem of an empty page, not knowing where to start.
: 
: I am a Social Scientist and my daily bread and butter is to synthesise knowledge, reproduce it, change it and generate new knowledge. However, most importantly, use that knowledge to have an impact in non-academic contexts (where it matters the most, I think).

: I was especially thinking about making a Twitter-like feed for mobile, to explore random blocks @danield
