#+title: ⭐ Dashboard
#+filetags: dashboard


Dashboard (not a very unique name, I know) is a set of tools to visualize personal data on a, well, some sort of dashboard.

I'm gradually publishing it [[https://github.com/karlicoss/dashboard][here]] and got some old screenshots [[https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/comments/cokt4f/what_do_you_all_do_with_your_data/ewmucgk][here]].

Ideally I'd like to reuse existing libraries and other people's projects to the maximum extent possible, so we could join forces.

Although in theory you can plug in any Pandas dataframes in it (assuming they fit the schema).

* [#A] * motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       mtvtn
:END:
- same motivation as for [[file:../quantifiedself/qs.org][quantified self]]
- a 'research' goal: figuring out the patterns and common routines for processing and preparing this data for visualizing.

** [#A] why not use something existing?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       whyntssmthngxstng
:END:
- low-code/no-code 'platforms' I've seen aren't enough to deal with noisy data or novel usecases.
  - filtering outliers, correcting data, etc., is mipossible in a no-code environment
  - something like seasonality detection would be impossible without a real programming language

- interoperability: if you want some data source that the platform doesn't support, too bad.

** [#B] figuring out core patterns for manipulating and representing this data
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fgrngtcrpttrnsfrmnpltngndrprsntngthsdt
:END:
Many things are very tedious to redo and reinvent from scratch every time
- #datetime handling
  - missing dates (e.g. parsing errors)
  - some data sources hane timezones, some don't.
    Some are a mixture, which is even worse. E.g. depending on the language you can't sort the dates with mixed timezones.
- #errors handling
  Quantified self data is often fuzzy/incomplete etc. If manual inputs are involved, parsing errors are inevitable.
  While in most software it's reasonable to crash on the first error, this would be very annoying if your dashboard breaks of one broken data point!
  On the other hand, you don't want to filter out errors either, since you'd never know they were present in the first place.

  So it needs to be something in between, a pattern for propagating errors as far as possible, and handling them gracefully during the visualization phase.

- detecting holidays
  E.g. for almost all data it makes sense to differentiate/correlate against days off work

- geographical/location data

: Extensible: Even a system with fantastic visualizations and powerful analysis has limited utility.
: This is because it can only show what the original authors assumed would be useful. Heedy offers a powerful plugin system - plugin writers can add new integrations, plots, or even modify core functionality with a few lines of python or javascript.
: A registry is planned, so that users can install plugins with the click of a button.


- [2020-08-23] interesing, automatic jupyter notebook connection??
- [2021-02-06] yeah looks like very much what I want
- [2021-04-27] hmm
  seems that fitbit integration is the only one present so far
  however after giving it a go, it restarted a couple of times, and ended up with a couple of zombie processes
  couldn't restart it without completely tearing down the docker container :(
  Overall not sure where it all fits: there are lots of repositories and not many concrete usecases https://github.com/heedy

: A high-level app and dashboarding solution for Python
: Panel works with visualizations from Bokeh, Matplotlib, HoloViews, and many other Python plotting libraries


ok, this is super promising:
: Panel can also be used with the separate Param project to create interactively configurable objects with or without associated visualizations, in a fully declarative way. With this approach, you declare your configurable object using the pure-Python, zero-dependency param library, annotating your code with parameter ranges, documentation, and dependencies between parameters and your code. Using this information, you can make all of your domain-specific code be optionally configurable in a GUI, with optional visual displays and debugging information if you like, all with just a few lines of declarations. With this approach, you don’t ever have to decide whether your code will eventually be used in a notebook, in a GUI app, or completely behind the scenes in batch processing, servers, or reports – the same code can support all of these cases equally well, once you declare the associated parameters and constraints.

:END:
data is inherently messy and error prone
it's sensible to be defensive and try to relax as much as possible (unless you have time to literally tend to them immediately)
on the other hand, you want to make sure you are aware about the issues in data
example: running dashboard -- has a warning about 0 speed
see screenshot at the same time (fix JS table first so duration & start_time have proper rendering)
you can instantly see it on the plot (yellow markers). if you hover, you'll see that the error is about zero speed (and you can also see it in the table)
in the table, you can clearly spot that the problem is the treadmill -- indeed, treadmill wasn't connected to the phone in any way, and I'm stationary, so endomondo has no idea how much I moved
however, I did log the distance (along with the training regime) manually
by combining the HR data (recorded by endomondo) and manual data we get the complete representation
(if I add visual highlight on the table, that would be fucking amazing)

: R-R intervals, TP, and HF/TP were significantly decreased while LF/TP and LF/HF were significantly increased during the early recovery, when compared with control values. This could be a response to the significant decrease in SAP and DAP at this time. Twenty-four and 48 h after the end of the exercise, HRV parameters were at the same levels as before exercises in the supine posture, but a persistent tachycardia continued to be observed in the upright posture, together with reduced TP values, showing that cardiovascular functions were still disturbed. The short-term HRV recovery seemed dependent on the type of exercise, contrary to the long-term recovery.

: I pretty much 100% agree with your assessment. I personally would also add:
: 
:     Automatic backup of data.
:     API for simple daily import of data (e.g. from manual or unsupported trackers). To me CSV import is inferior solution, especially for dashboard, where the point is to have the data visualized persistently.
:     I would expand the ‘flexible data analysis’ to following specific analysis that I feel are essential (but I haven’t seen anywhere):
:     a. cross-correlation across time to uncover temporally delayed relationships between tracked variables
:     b. automatic application of the above to all pairs of variables with report of the strongest relationships found
:     c. proper reporting of statistical significance of any correlations found
:     d. multi-variate regression

motivaion: good points about what's missing from most current solutions
