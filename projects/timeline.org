Timeline is a simple attempt to display various life events as list. Sort of a simplistic #memex.

whoa very nice interface (different 'tracks' for different contexts)
could have
- environment context
- location context
- 'acitivity' context
- body state context (like sleeping?)
however I'm not sure about HTML, probably infeasible? although by-month + last month would be kinda ok
guess the code isn't that complicated though

: Kudos - this looks like a great project and is fully usable now.
: I have a similar project, DL, that's unfinished. Mine revolves around using a custom API in both Rust and REST to aggregate all my digital life events using ActivityStreams 2.0 and extensions to that, in a manner that is decentralized and ranked/categorized through machine learning. I am still working on it and releasing it Open Source is one of this year's goals.
: My motivation is that the amount of information I receive from Twitter,Mastodon,Facebook,Reddit,HN,various Stack exchanges,blog postings,etc. has gotten to the point where it's too easy to miss things.
: Jeremie Miller, one of the creators of XMPP, had something similar revolving around the Telehash protocol. As far as I can tell, that effort is discontinued, or at least no longer Open Source.

: The Database that Syncs!
: PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.

: It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online, keeping the user's data in sync no matter where they next login.

: Hoodie is a noBackend technology — it's there for making the lives of frontend developers easier by abstracting away the backend and keeping you from worrying about backends. It gives you Dreamcode: a simple, easy-to-learn-and-implement frontend API built into it. Hoodie is also Offline First, which means that your app users’ data is stored locally by default so your Hoodie-based apps are accessible and usable anytime, independent from your users’ internet connection.
