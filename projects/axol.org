** TODO why not hnrss?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-11-30]
:ID:       whynthnrss
:END:
it's very likely more convenient to use if you only want a few HN queries, and don't care about historic ones
** TODO why axol over rss bridges?
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED:  [2020-12-05]
:ID:       whyxlvrrssbrdgs
:END:
rss is awesome! downsides
- might be trickier to do various post-filtering
- with axol, you can compare results across queries (user summary)
- can be used with promnesia maybe
** STRT motivation: I don't understand how google search alerts work. e.g. try on openbci query (see my old emails from google alert)

: I've just started using Feedbin about a month ago, and although my HN firehose feed is at like 1100 something, it definitely limits the rest of the HN feeds. The show and ask feeds are both stuck around 400 something.
** [#D] [2018-11-24] problems with diff approach
:PROPERTIES:

eh. sooo, there are no dupes even!! BS4 actually sees only 20 per page (pinboard still gives us '50' in the next url).
whereas chrome does show up 50 entries; but if you go to the second page they are gonna overlap.
