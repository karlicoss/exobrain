hmm wonder if that does it. they mention triangulation.

Triangulate the manifold
then do some sort of random walk and stop at the initial point with some probability
then, do some sort of simulated annealing to transform the loops according to the certain rules.
basically, we can contract certain subpaths (or expand?) e.g. a -> b -> a can be contracted to a. unless the points are glued?
try to guess groups from equivalence classes? then try combining them and guessing against known groups?

to contract, define some sort of 'tension' function? not sure if makes sense

this is a conservative method in the sense that it can answer what your fundamental group is NOT
in a sense, fundamental group is a conservative concept too, it can answer what your topological space is NOT


triangulation, or squares? 

if the point or edge is glued, treat it as special?

basically you declare some of the loops as 'trivial', but manually

however, that's not enough to classify, we should be considering edges instead?

most useful so far.. the idea is you construct spanning tree, choose a base point and assign all loops from base point to 1 (for each edge not in the maximal tree). does that work for higher dimensions??

right, apparently to compute really effeciently we need van kampen theorem..

: Kruskal's algorithm will give you a maximal tree, and after that the presentation just involves listing the remaining edges as generators, and listing the relations that come from the 2-simplices. I don't really see anything interesting going on algorithmically once you've selected a maximal tree.

: Depends on what you mean by "computing" and "algorithm". It is undecidable (even for a two-complex) whether the fundamental group is trivial, though computing a presentation is relatively easy.
