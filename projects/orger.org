: For those unaware, saving things on Reddit as a non-Premium member works in the following way:
:     limited to 1000 saved things (posts and comments) total; once the limit is reached, older things are replaced and essentially deleted from history
:     saves are stored in reverse chronological order (latest to oldest)
:     no way whatsoever to filter or sort saved content
:     no searching capability is provided
:     pagination limit on Reddit site is limited to 25 items, thus requiring users to use the “Next Page” or “Prev Page” buttons a lot

wow, the fuck?? they are deleted from history??

Hi, this yet another demo of Orger and today I want to show how I'm using it to process my Hackernews bookmarks.

So, on my Andoird phone I'm using this app, called Materialistic.
It's a nice, clean, open source. It cache articles for offline, so I quite like it.

But, one downside is that the list of saved items its not synchronised with your Hackernews account.
That is, it only keeps saved articles locally on the phone.

I guess the main reason is because Hackernews doesn't have an API. So if the developers were to implement saving functionality,
they would have to use web scraping etc, which is tedious. But anyway, that's not the point.
Because even if it sync, your save items list on hackernews is static.
You can't reorder it, you can't prioritize it, you can't add some comment or annotation.

(TODO show screenshot)

And I'm saving a lot of links, and I don't have enough time to read all of them.

So.. and let me show how Orger helps with this.
TODO jump to the file
So as you can see I've already got some stuff organized. For now let's jump to the end, where new saved items are added.
It's easy to spot items that are new, since they don't have a priority yet.
So what I would normally do is -- I would check out this file, perhaps once it couple of weeks.

First, I'm going through new items, and putting a priority on each of them from A to D, just based on the title.
TODO so for example (show examples of items the I want to read now, hence put A, and unlikely, so put D)

Once I've done that, I can sort everything. So we can select everything. and call org-sort-entries, and choose 'prioirity'
And -- whoops, you can see it's put the highest priority stuff on the top.

So I've got like, two articles marked as A, which I can read right now.
Sometimes I would also go through the items marked as B/C and once again, top up the prirority, sort, and here you go.
That way you can process the most important and relevant stuff and keep up to your content queue.

One question people often ask -- if you admit you will probably never have time to read everything, why don't you just remove stuff with the lowest priority.

Two ansers: 1 -- sometimes I might go throught them and top up the priority. TODO priorities change, etc., so I might be TODO to read this later.

The second answer -- it's useful for search. So I might not necessarily read the item directly. But I've got a global search over all of my information.

TODO demonstrate, for example.

I'm using similar TODO for reddit.
And you can set it up for pretty much anything similar.


TODO demonstrate on global search for 'Database Schema'?

TODO set (setq frame-title-format "%b") in emacs for presentation mode



TODO at the end of video demonstrate HPI?? and the command running in cron?
TODO the script running on phone? ... not sure...
but could show a snippet I guess
crontab -l | grep materialistic, etc
