https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness
: The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining how and why sentient organisms have qualia or phenomenal experiences—how and why it is that some internal states are felt states, such as heat or pain, rather than unfelt states, as in a thermostat or a toaster.[1] The philosopher David Chalmers, who introduced the term "hard problem" of consciousness,[2] contrasts this with the "easy problems" of explaining the ability to discriminate, integrate information, report mental states, focus attention, and so forth.

: Look up Willoughby Britton's research - The Dark Side of the Contemplative Path. She's a neuroscientist doing research into meditation, and one of her projects is exactly what you're asking about.
: 
: I can share a personal anecdote too. As I've got more into meditation, I have felt all the expected positive outcomes - more tranquil, more equanimity in my dealings with people, just generally more calm and ordered internally. However the expanded awareness that has come, not necessarily directly because of meditation but the things i've been using my new-found attention to focus on, has caused a few bouts of existential depression and anxiety. I think this is only natural as we confront our Shadow selves in the natural introspective part of the meditation journey - it's meant to be tough, so we can appreciate the light on the other side. Hell, purgatory, and heaven are not physical places but personal mental states that you can experience.

:END:
:  By dullness I mean a subtle lack of clarity of awareness, which, if nothing is done about it, tends to gradually increase to the point of tiredness/drowsiness, and eventually sleep. A lot of people succeed in stopping gross dullness but continue to meditate in subtle dullness. A good way to tell if you're meditating with subtle dullness is if a background sound causes a "startle" effect, where your body or even just your mind will have a sudden "jolt" caused by the sound. If you meditate frequently you probably know what I mean. As clarity of awareness increases, sounds are less likely to startle you.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)
: Bicameralism (the condition of being divided into "two-chambers") is a hypothesis in psychology that argues that the human mind once operated in a state in which cognitive functions were divided between one part of the brain which appears to be "speaking", and a second part which listens and obeys — a bicameral mind. The term was coined by Julian Jaynes, who presented the idea in his 1976 book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,[1] wherein he made the case that a bicameral mentality was the normal and ubiquitous state of the human mind as recently as 3,000 years ago, near the end of the Mediterranean bronze age.
