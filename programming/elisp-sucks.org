#+title: ‚≠ê Elisp sucks (and can we make it suck less?)
#+filetags: elisp

Emacs is often praised for Elisp, which is presented as some sort of silver bullet and magical tool that solves everything.
In my opinion, this raises the expectations too high, and then you end up disappointed when you struggle to do very simple things (and you even end up having impostor thoughts).
Emacs is possibly the most malleable environment out there, I use it all the time and enjoy hacking it, however I like the result, not the process. I often feel that I have to do it despite Elisp.

The purpose of this not is not just to rant, but
- share annoyances and point people at ways of coping with them
- share clues for people familiar with other languages (like python/js)
- hopefully if many people have the same problems, we can even improve Elisp language or certain default behaviours

[2019-10-19] [[https://twitter.com/karlicoss/status/1185607527460937729][how it started]]
: I just started writing down reasons why elisp sucks every time I'm frustrated, so I can let off the steam instead of shitposting and ranting. It might actually result into something useful.


Some of my context.

- I'm familiar with many programming languages, paradigms and programming language theory
  (not bragging or anything, I just think it makes it easier to discuss if we refer to the concepts we are all familiar with)
- most days, I write Python
  - TODO link on python-is-good
- I've spent a fair bit of time hacking on my emacs config and scripts for building the blog, etc, so I feel like I might be in the top percentile of Emacs users who engage with lisps
- Elisp is the first actual Lisp I've coded on. Pretty much the only too, the other one is clojure, and only since very recently.
  Also some things I mention are common to all lisps, but since there are many people for who Elisp is the only one they use, I hope it's valid.

* standard library

Disclaimer: different people obviously engage with different parts of standard library so YYMV.

** very inconsistent naming
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       vryncnsstntnmng
:END:
Of course naming is a hard problem, but it's not that big of an issue in some other languages:
- in C++/Java (OO languages), you can refer to the documentation of the objects' class, e.g. [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector#Member_functions][~std::vector~]]
  granted, someone has to generate the documentation in the first place, but in the worst case you can check the class' source code/header file
- in Python/JS you can do the same (e.g. [[https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists][python's list docs]])
  in addition, you can use the REPL (something like ~dir/vars~) to discover which methods/properties the object has
- Haskell is not OO, but you can use something like [[https://hoogle.haskell.org/?hoogle=Text%20-%3E%20Text][Hoogle]] to discover all functions that operate on a given data type

In untyped language like Elisp all bets are off, the only way to find out how to use the object are
- rely on the documentation (and it's a mess)
- read the package source code to discover all the functions available, perhaps search over variable names
  this is usually what I have to resort to, even for builtin packages like org-mode

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       tbfrtlspmfndngcljrsffrngfrmthsmprblm
:END:
Although naming is better subjectively (possibly because the language is yonger), it's still a mess of untyped walls of text
- https://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet
- https://clojuredocs.org/quickref#sequences

The nice thing clojure docs have are the community provided examples

I hope this is a constructive thing I (or someone else) can borrow from Clojure for Elisp.

** list manipulation routines are bad
:PROPERTIES:

Somehow I almost never manage to figure out (or at least much left often comparing to other PLs).
Thankfully, in emacs you can use ~find-function~ and just read the source code, it's often easier.

* no types
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ntyps
:END:
for the context, I don't mean strict/static types or whatever. I just want something like optional gradual typing, like #mypy
- yes, elisp is very dynamic and it's kind of futile (and often counterproductive) to annotate everything with types
  but some things are clearly typeable
  - nullable string (~?string~ in JS flow)
  - list of 'things' (.e.g. ~any[]~ in typescript)
  - side effect only function (~None~ return type in mypy)
  As a result of missing types, this has to be repeated in the documentation, in vague human language.

- yes, in elisp it's often easier to just inspect the object in question (e.g. in repl or the debugger) instead of thinking of it in terms of types
- yes, you can add type checking (clojure things?), but I've never really seen it done except for ~defcustom~

maybe it's just org-mode thing since this is the only 'big' elisp system I worked with
example with org-element-set/adopt in exobrain source code
if it was language with 'real' types, it would be easy to dir() or somethign to see what methods are available
but maybe it would be less flexible, I dunno
on the other hands it means that you can always hack it *somehow* and then maybe figure out 'proper'
but discoverability really suffers

- fuck poor standard library and need for cl-lib
  "buffers are a better abstraction than strings"?
  https://twitter.com/zeRusski/status/1210254995628707840
  - hmm okay this has a point, I have to think about it.
    I guess it's true to some extent, but sometimes I do want to manipulate strings to make the code more pure

- fuck lack of proper lexical binding
  file-local variable
  also not sure what was the last time it bothered me... maybe some deafults changed?
- fuck lack of currying
  currying : dash.el ~it~ things, also partial/rpartial
  kind of cool actually that it's implemented xxx (on the other hand would be possible in python too? with a special object or something)
- fuck parentheses (admit this one is subjective)
  multiple types of parens makes it much better (like in clojure)
  but unlikely it's something solvable within elisp
