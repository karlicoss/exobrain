This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing tuples or confusingly behaving namedtuples. Which in turn encourages you to write small classes that do one thing well. Never again violate the single responsibility principle just because implementing __init__ et al is a painful drag.

Associating functions with actions like this is typically the easiest way to handle the different actions for each of your subparsers. However, if it is necessary to check the name of the subparser that was invoked, the dest keyword argument to the add_subparsers() call will work:

:END:
: As one point of comparison, SymPy is comically slow compared to Sage. This is mostly because SymPy is purely Python; Sage on the other hand uses a derivative of GiNaC [1] for its internal symbolic expression representation, and then multiple external libraries for non-trivial operations. Symbolic transformations are mostly Maxima [3]. Sage literally converts expressions to strings, pipes them through a Maxima process, and then parses the result back. This is still much faster than the pure Python SymPy.
: There is an effort to speed up SymPy core, SymEngine [3], but it's been in development for years now, and still isn't integrated into SymPy. Not sure why.
: Case in point: 'expand("(2+3x+4x*y)^60")' takes 5 seconds with SymPy; Sage does the same in 0.02 seconds.

:END:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27907373/dynamically-change-slots-in-python-3
: Normally, an object's attributes are stored in a dict, which requires a fair bit of memory itself. If you are creating millions of objects then the space required by these dicts becomes prohibitive. __slots__ informs the python machinery that makes the class object that there will only be so many attributes refered to by instances of this class and what the names of the attributes will be. Therefore, the class can make an optimisation by storing the attributes directly on the instance rather than in a dict. It places the memory for the (pointers to the) attributes directly on the object, rather than creating a new dict for the object.

:  Yes. I've written a few systems using SQLAlchemy that see 50-100k writes  and 200k or so reads per second, and as long as you're using the Core everything works fine. Also allows you to use the ORM for ease-of-development on bits that don't need performance.
: 
:  SQLAlchemy is probably the one library in which I've never reached the "wait, I need to do something and can't" point. Every single weird edge case I've had to handle has been supported either natively or by being able to access the raw interfaces directly in a clean way. Fantastic library, can't recommend it more highly.

: Compare Bokeh with Plotly
: 1. Easy to install. The process is very similar to Plotly.
: 2. Bokeh plot is not as interactive as Plotly.
: 3. Limitation on drawing string value on plot. It looks like only the bar chart can take the string values. Date time string has to convert to DateTime type first in order to be on non-bar plots such as scatter, line, etc.
: 4. It is not easy to overlay different type of plots on one figure.
: 5. Less examples online.
: 6. Less integrated with Panda than Plotly.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5nwk9r/plotly_vs_bokeh_vs/
: The last advantage I found that plotly has over bokeh is that almost everything in plotly is a dict. This is really useful because I've found certain plotly functions are really slow for some reason or can't be called when you use the multiprocessing module because of pickling issues. Not a problem, in the end they generate dicts under the hood, you can do the same yourself and still pass those dicts to plotly. Also calling help() on plotly objects tells you what keys and values you need to add to your dict.

:     - Ability to write tests directly in notebooks without having to learn special APIs. These tests get executed in parallel with a single CLI command. You can even define certain groups of tests such that you don't have to always run long-running tests.
