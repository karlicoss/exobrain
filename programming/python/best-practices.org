- uses the built in =assert=
  : assert 1 == 1, 'This is my error message, which is optional'
- parameterized tests
- fixtures: These aren't the setup/teardown fixtures (per-se), but more like dependency injection (and are incredibly useful). You can even inject a fixture into a fixture (say you need to log in a user, but you need an HTTP client for it to work, you probably use that client elsewhere so DRY it up):
- markers: Easy way to categorize tests (and coincidentally run only those groups)
  : @pytest.mark.slow
  : def test_slow_running_thing():
  :     time.sleep(500)
- parallel execution via xdist

* [#B] [2020-02-12] Guido van Rossum on Twitter: "@jonasrk You missed mypy. Simpler docs use markdown, not ReST (Sphinx). Black is overrated unless your team argues over style a lot. You don't need Pylint if you're using flake8. Never heard of poetry or dependabot. And you should use a CI solution, e.g. Travis-CI, to run your tests." / Twitter https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1227126706089021440
