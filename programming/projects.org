How to make good programming (specially open source) projects?

I don't claim to be an expert, but I think I have accumulated a fair amound of experience.

Here I collect best practices, or at least the ones I liked.

- it's nice if you can provide a web-based demo that doesn't require any installation.
- perhaps the next worst thing is something like a Docker container -- you can safely try it knowing you won't mess up your OS
  It also basically means 'reproducible build', and easer testing.

I found screencasting to be pretty finicky.
Especially when you want to automate things, e.g. like I did with short demos for [[https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia#readme][promnesia]].
(see [[https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/blob/65e77cd67740ef391cba73bc9eac200d9a5b6e63/tests/demos.py][demos.py]] -- it's extremely hacky and not sure how to make it generic)

: Peek does not support this natively. But you could install an external tool like key-mon which is usually included in most distributions, so you can easily install with your package manager. Then start key-mon with key-mon --visible_click. The --visible_click option is for drawing small circles around mouse clicks.

- [2020-04-02] looked at peek for demo automation, and it doesn't quite do the trick
  - you can continue/pause recording from the console
  - you can't set window id/adjust (granted, you can do it externally via xdotool which is arguably more modular)
  - you can't set recording format/path from the console (and even save the video?)
    that made it useless for my purposes

: If you are the copyright holder, it's up to you how you license your work —I think the only catch is that you can't retrospectively revoke open-source licenses for previous versions, but I think you could easily publish an updated version with a different license, or even license with two different licenses if you wanted to. Also, if others have previously contributed to the project whilst it was under a given license, you will need their permission to relicense it, unless you have a copyright-grant agreement with them (such that they assign copyright to their contributions to you).

It's annoying to have to come up with name when the project is ready and you are keen to release it.
- my personal strategy is thinking and having short brainstoming sessions now and then and writing down ideas
  Then after some time I just pick the one I like most.
- use thesaurus to find synonyms
- make sure it's unique enough, search for existing projects with the same name
