:PROPERTIES:

:END:
: Inversion of Control principle, which basically states that the flow of your application depends on the object graph that is built up during program execution, and such a dynamic flow is made possible by object interactions being defined through abstractions.
: This run-time binding is achieved by mechanisms such as dependency injection or a service locator.

:END:
: Ionic is basically Cordova with Angular on top with a convenient CLI. In my experience Cordova apps tend to be laggy in the long run and the debugging process is relatively annoying when trying to debug native plugins (you have to build the app via xcode etc.). You should be aware that Cordova uses the web view to display the app. So it’s kinda like running a web page on your phone and trying to convince the user it’s a native app.
: React native on the other hand uses the native components of the OS. So it’s not a web view, which means your app will feel much smoother. The downside of react native is that it uses its own components on top of the native ones which makes it hard to reuse your frontend code to the extent you  could with a Cordova app.
: Personal opinion: In my opinion and based on my past experience I would go with react native if I had to choose a framework based on JavaScript.
: Hope this helps :)

:     Extend the search path for the modules which comprise a package. Intended use is to place the following code in a package’s __init__.py:
: 
:     from pkgutil import extend_path
:     __path__ = extend_path(__path__, __name__)
: 
:     This will add to the package’s __path__ all subdirectories of directories on sys.path named after the package. This is useful if one wants to distribute different parts of a single logical package as multiple directories.
