* [2015-11-20] Why asynctasks are bad?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       frwhysynctsksrbd
:END:
1. AsyncTasks are not composable, To run two (or more) dependent asyncTasks you need to run one from another.
2. Error handling needs boilerplate: To handle error in main thread you need to return null as result (and losing error information in onPostExecute), or wrap your result in some kind of Either, where you provide result or error
3. AsyncTasks force you to handle result in main thread (even when it's intermediate result, and should not be handled in main thread yet)
4. And of course Activity/Fragment lifecycle, but that's the point why loaders were introduced.

:  Ionic is just a UI.
:  Think of all the UI peculiarities when you use your iPhone. Now imagine trying to hand roll all of that in CSS. Doable, but a real PITA. That's why Ionic was developed.
:  Phone gap is a totally different thing and is what compiles your code into somethin iOS or android understands.

:  Hello!
:  Using cordova on it's own has grown out of fashion due to the amount of things you are required to set it up to make it look like a semi decent app. That said, there are those who still do that, but they likely have a suite of things they've developed over time to make use of it.
:  Phonegap isn't a different framework though, it's the non open source version of Cordova that is marketed by Adobe.
:  Ionic is the framework you'd most likely be looking, as they do provide a number of useful mobile components, and styles.
:  You could also look into React Native, as the community is growing at a faster rate than Ionic did. It doesn't use Cordova at all, but rather the JavaScript runtime on iOS & Android to make use of the platforms' native UI components.

:END:
: Ionic is basically Cordova with Angular on top with a convenient CLI. In my experience Cordova apps tend to be laggy in the long run and the debugging process is relatively annoying when trying to debug native plugins (you have to build the app via xcode etc.). You should be aware that Cordova uses the web view to display the app. So it’s kinda like running a web page on your phone and trying to convince the user it’s a native app.
: React native on the other hand uses the native components of the OS. So it’s not a web view, which means your app will feel much smoother. The downside of react native is that it uses its own components on top of the native ones which makes it hard to reuse your frontend code to the extent you  could with a Cordova app.
: Personal opinion: In my opinion and based on my past experience I would go with react native if I had to choose a framework based on JavaScript.
: Hope this helps :)
