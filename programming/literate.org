* [#A] [2019-09-24] it started bothering me increasingly. formulating thoughts is hard and when you've came up and TODO shaped? good atom of information, last thing you want to do is duplicate it.

it gets worse when you have different markdown formats (e.g. RST for python)

: docopt helps you:
: 
: define the interface for your command-line app, and
: automatically generate a parser for it.
: 
: docopt is based on conventions that have been used for decades in help messages and man pages for describing a program's interface. An interface description in docopt is such a help message, but formalized. Here is an example:

: In practice, very few pieces of software are written in a way that lends itself to a cohesive narrative. Software is written by numerous developers, layer by layer, often with hacks thrown in. New people come on, don't understand the whole thing, change parts of it, and move on. The requirements change, and the system contorts itself to serve multiple purposes that weren't envisioned by the original coders.
